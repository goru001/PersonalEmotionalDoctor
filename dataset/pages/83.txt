supposed to do? The guru says, 'awareness means awareness which means do not try and to find a logic behind it. Awareness means just be aware of your thoughts;
just watch your thoughts. We are aware of everything that is
happening in the world. We are aware of what is happening
under the ocean; we are aware of what is happening on the
moon; we are aware of what is happening on other planets;
we are aware of what is happening in the neighbour's house;
we are aware of what is happening everywhere. So, awareness
means to know what's happening. Now, awareness means just
to know what's happening...
SO: Within me?
SS: Nothing within. That again is very complicated. When
you say look within, it's very complicated. Look within, but
where? Look at what? What are we supposed to do? Look
within means just look at the thoughts that I create. Take a
walk early in the morning; its not about just looking at who is
walking, who is wearing what, who is listening to music, who
is talking about what, what has happened in the newspaper;
just talk to yourself. What am I thinking? You can practise
this the whole day.
SO: People will say this guy is talking to himself and has
gone mad.
SS: You won't come to know when I am talking to myself. Just
stop and check - What am I thinking?
SO: But the moment I stop to check what I am thinking,
that thought stops. Some other thought then takes over me
