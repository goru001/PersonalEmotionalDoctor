SS: See, whenever I take the mind to something else, what
happens? I am watching a television show or a movie. What
happens? Whatever was going on in my mind has been put
off for some time. Suppose you have a toothache and you start
watching a movie, very soon you will forget the toothache.
When you switch off the TV, the pain seems to start again.
What happened? Does it mean that the tooth was healed and
now it's again hurt? No, it was always in pain but the mind
was distracted. My tooth is paining and I am aware of the
pain. Who is aware of the pain? The mind is. Then I take my
mind to something else, whether it's a conversation, a shopping
trip, or a television programme. I feel the pain is gone but it
is not - it's just that I am not aware of the pain. Then, when
the TV is switched off, I can feel the pain again. Now this is
the case of a physical pain, same is when there is an emotional
pain. The whole day was tough, I created a lot of stress and
anxiety; then I say let's go for a movie, 'let's go for a holiday.
'let's take a break from here and go away for 15 days.
SO: Is it escapism?
SS: It's just that we are trying to take the mind away from there.
SO: Shall we call it temporary happiness?
SS: Not happiness, it's a temporary deviation of the mind from
the truth. It's not happiness because we are coming back to it
after sometime. See, we can call it happiness if it was healed;
your tooth was not healed, it was just that you were not aware
of the pain.
