these are only words. We say very few words compared
to how much we think. There could be 25 to 30 thoughts per minute 
but not 25 to 30 sentences in the same time. One may not be using even 4 to 5 sentences in a minute. Every thought
has an effect on the entire system, on every cell of the body
Thoughts are the most powerful source of energy that we have,
so let's be careful about how we use them. It's like you possess
nuclear energy - you can use it for healing and you can use it
to destroy the world. The energy is the same. You have your
MRI, CT scan, etc., done with nuclear energy on one hand,
and you also have all the nuclear missiles on the other hand.
They are the same energy. Every form of energy can be used
for constructive as well as destructive purpose. It's the same
with thought energy. It can give and create love, peace, purity; it can give and create hatred, resentment, worry, anxiety. It's 
the same thought energy but the wonderful part is that these
are my thoughts, so I have a choice.
SO: I am still thinking about what you said just now about
every thought having an effect on my body. If I am going
to think thousands and thousands of thoughts in a day and
millions of thoughts in a month or my lifetime, what will
happen to my body?
SS: See, mostly for an illness the doctors will tell us it's
psychosomatic, that is the connection of the mind and the
body. So heal the mind, the body will follow. Of course
you
must take care of the body, but it will not be of much use if
we take care only of the body and don't heal the mind. That's
why someone will say I am a strict vegetarian; I don't smoke;
I dont drink; I exercise every day, and yet I had a heart attack
