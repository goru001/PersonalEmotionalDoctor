they shouldn't have said this. If I go into the future, my thought
can be: When this happens then I will be happy. This means
now I am not happy. It's not a nice thought
SO: Now I understand why people say 'I didn't do anything
today why am I so tired?' If he had gone to play a game of
golf, he wouldn't have been so tired.
SS: Yes then the mind wouldn't have been creating so many
negative and waste thoughts, while it was concentrating on
something else
Forty to fifty thousand thoughts in a day! If they are not
of the right quality, what will happen to the system inside? A
psychiatrist will tell us that, on an average, 80 per cent of the
time the mind is in the past and 15 per cent of the time it is
in the future and so 95 per cent is gone as waste
SO: And out of the 80 per cent wonder how much is positive.
SS: There is nothing positive in the past because if it was a
pleasant past and I am thinking about it, then I am thinking
that those days were better. So there is nothing positive there.
People say it is good to have nice memories. Yes, it's a memory
but it's past. It's over. What is important is now.
SO: How often people speak about the past when you meet
them. You should have seen the salutes I received when I
was in the army, when I was a general; I was this; I was that
SS: What you are feeling inside right now is this: those were
the days when I got all of that from everybody, but today I
don't have that kind of attention. So, by saying all this about
my past, I am trying to seek attention from people around me.
