I am a peaceful and happy being, but I get to experience it
and express it only when I am in interaction with someone. If
I am sitting by myself, I don't get to express or experience my
own qualities, and that's why relationships are so important,
Unless I am in interaction, unless I have this exchange of
energy, I will not be expressing and experiencing. I experience
my quality only when it comes out. When I give anger to
you, first I experience it; similarly, when I give peace to you,
first I experience it. I get to experience it only when I am in
interaction with someone and so I look forward to going to
work; I look forward to meeting families and friends - not
for wanting but for expressing and experiencing, and therefore
sharing.

action'.
SO: Human being doing action.. Let's bring the whole
thing into a small meditation.
SS: Relax and Reflect on these thoughts.
