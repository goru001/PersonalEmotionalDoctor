shouting at me. Now, instead of taking care of how I should
be, I'm telling you this is not how you should be talking to me.
While I am trying to change your script I go out of control,
and soon I forget my own script and I am shouting louder
than you did. When I start to write your script and forget my
own lines, what will happen to the play?
SO: Disaster.
SS: That's what's happening everywhere around. If we just
start focusing on our script, everyone else will take their cue
Someone next to you is getting angry, has lost his temper,
is going out of control, but if you remain in control he will
soon come back into control because you have retained your
composure. You are writing your script and they will come back
to their original quality of peace. The other possibility is that
soon everyone will forget their script and go out of control.
This is a choice we need to make that of writing our own
script, because that's the only one that will be followed in any
case. The others will go into the category of waste thoughts.
So let's be aware of this, because this is awareness. I am aware
of how many times in the day I just keep thinking about what
other people should be doing and saying.
SO: But why can't I just stop myself and ask what is the
point, why am I wasting time?
SS: Now we will do it because we are aware; earlier we were
not aware, so we thought it was natural to think like that.
Its like you see a tap running and you immediately close it
because water is getting wasted.
