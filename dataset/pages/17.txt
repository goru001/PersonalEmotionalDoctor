To Create the Thought,
to Embrace the Journey
SO: We have been talking about dependency in happiness
how we are dependent on so many things for happiness.
Sister Shivani, you say it is 'I' who create happiness, I
who create sadness. It's finally I who is responsible. Yet
it's very difficult to be happy when you have not achieved
something in life.
SS: There are two dynamics here: one, if I achieve this then
I will be happy, and another, I will be happy while achieving
this. Its like we are on a journey, say from X to Y, and Y is
the destination whether we are going by road, by train, or
by air. When we start on the journey, others wish us a safe
journey, not 'reach your destination anyways. It's not only
reaching the destination that matters, it's the quality of the
journey that counts.
