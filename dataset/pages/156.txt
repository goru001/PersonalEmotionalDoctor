SO: But what kind of visualisation did you give her? You
said 'just think that everything is fine; nothing is wrong'
SS: If a partner or a child is drifting away in a relationship
what's the energy that we send out to them? Anger or hurt
Someone is already drifting away and we are sending out
negative energy. It will only take them further away. If you
want the person to come back, you have to send powerful
positive energy. For that we need to stop being critical and

nothing wrong has happened. From the other person's
perspective, they have logic for what they are doing; we may
find it wrong but they have a reason. I have spoken to

will never be able to decide who is right and who is wrong
because none of them is wrong. You listen to one and you will
say, 'perfect, this person is absolutely right'. Then you listen
to the other person and what they say seems to be making
sense as well. It's just that each one is right from their own
perspective. Now all that we have to do is show them each
other's perspective.
