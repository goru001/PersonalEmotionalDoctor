SS: Relax and reflect on these thoughts
Let us sit back and be comfortable I look at myself.I,
the creator of every thought and feeling . There are pressures
in life targets to achieve deadlines to meet It's just a
pressure. I am the one who is going to achieve the target
let me take care of myself as I work towards achieving the target
. The quality of my thoughts and felings as I move towards
the target .. any fear any anxiety any worry.. let me
first sit back and change the quality of the thought I am a
powerfiul being I can achieve what I have decided but I
will first take care of myself... Nothing and no one can influence
my state of being .. It's totally in my control I, the powerful
being protected and secure.. now move towards my target.
This is my journey, a journey of happiness. Om Shantil

. Stress is a pain that comes to make us realise that there
is something I need to change.
.Stress is our creation of negative thoughts, which has
an effect on our efficiency, memory power, decision
power and, hence, our performance
Stress has an impact on our physical and emotional
well-being, and hence, any amount of stress is damaging
Targets, pressures, deadlines, exams, etc., are natural
but stress is our choice.
