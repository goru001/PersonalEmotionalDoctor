he is doing, with the thought, 'I want to come into the market
as his competitor and I want to take my revenge. I believe
I am right.' So you parted ways since your partner did not
conduct himself in an ethical manner. But you want to now
start a business with the feeling of taking revenge is this the
kind of energy that you want to bring into your new work?
Is this your thought process while starting the new venture?
This you have to ask yourself. How you are going to think and
feel is your choice. You are hurt and for how long you will
remain hurt is also your choice. You want to live with your
pain for 10 minutes, 10 days, or 10 years, is your choice. You
can sit back, think of the situation, and relive the pain again
and again, even years after it happened. Who is the creator of
these emotions? It's you. In the same situation, different people
will create different responses. So this has to be experimented
with at every step
