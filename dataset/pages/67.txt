So: So why do we go for holidays, picnics, movies and all
that?
SS: It's a change: it's entertainment; it's different from the routine.
SO: Sister Shivani, please tell our readers a little about
meditation so that there is 24 x 7 happiness and one is not
always dependent on others for it.
SS: Let's just be aware of our thoughts and let's not try and
deviate our mind to something else in the pursuit of happiness.
We are suppressing the conscious mind by getting distracted and
then thinking that this will bring us happiness. The minute the
distraction is removed, my conscious mind is back there and
it is back with probably more pain. So I need to take charge;
this is not the solution, this is just running away from the
problem. But for how long can we run away? How long can
we be on a holiday? Finally, I am going to be back at work.

Relax and Reflect on these thoughts. Meditate.
Let's look at ourselves tomorrow at work.. whatever the
situation may be .. I am not blaming anyone I am not
going to hold anyone responsible for how I feel. because l
understand that I am the creator just when my mind is
about to say it's because of them... let me just stop and look
at myself .. do I have a choice to respond in another way..
what's my nature, my personality let it not get influenced by
the behaviours and personalities of others .. I am the radiator
of my qualities irrespective of whatever happens around me...
This is self-responsibility... Om Shanti!
