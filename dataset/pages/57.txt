I Have to Be Happy First
SO: Sister Shivani, having told myself that I am the person
in charge of my emotions; I cannot play the blame game
anymore. But I think it is very difficult to understand what
you are saying about not reacting to whatever anybody says
Is this possible?
SS: I do respond, but there is a difference. I am not saying
that we do not respond it's like you are saying something to
me and I am just a stone wall with no thoughts, feelings and
emotions. That's not right. The question is which thoughts,
which feelings, which emotions? It's not that I either react or
don't respond at all; reaction means an automated response.
Sometimes I have to regret my reactions. How many times we
have to say sorry to people?
S0: I end up regretting my words or action so many times.
SS: What do we regret?
