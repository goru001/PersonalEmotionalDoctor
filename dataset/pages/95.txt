temperary because the seed is the thought. Not changing the
thought it self will have a temporary effect; the change will last
for a few days and then we are back to the old self. However
if I change the thought, I won't even be aware but suddenly I 
will find so much transformation outside

SO: So we won't need to work on each and every aspect of
our body, our movement, our speech, the way we look, the
way we talk. It is just like what an actor does in method
acting. Method acting teaches us to go from within to the
outside. Once I start believing that I am so and so, then
I don't have to check on my walk, on the way I speak, it
happens naturally once I believe in it.
SS: I am creating the character inside; the whole sketch is there
inside. Who does this inner work? The mind does.
SO: When you believe in it, then things follow. You are not
acting anymore; you are living, you are playing.
SS: You are naturally flowing. Similarly, I am a peaceful being.
I have created the character inside, so now I don't have to take
care of how to speak, how to walk, how to behave. Once I 
am convinced inside that I the actor - am a peaceful being,
then everything that the actor will do will be through the
vibration of peace.
S0: So that means I should play the role of a peaceful
personality. Suresh Oberoi as a peaceful being, happy being...
SS: You have to come back to the root first. I the peaceful being
has this name, this body and plays this role. Whether its
an actor, a doctor, a lawyer, it doesn't matter what the role is.
