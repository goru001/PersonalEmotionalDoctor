in my 30s or 40s. That's because I took care only of the body,
while the mind was under stress.

Relax and Reflect on these thoughts. Meditate.
Let me just sit back, relax, and really look at my mind now, No one will come to know that I am looking. It's something that
goes on inside. And I am going to do it the whole day, while
I am working, while I am talking, while I am driving, while I am 
walking; it's about just being aware of my thoughts.
My thoughts, my creation something that I thought was
happening automatically.. I now realise the seed is me .. I am
the creator of every thought .. every thought has an influence
on my body . and on everyone around me... .Let me look at
my thoughts .. flowing beautifully in control because I
realize I am the master.... Whatever happens around me 
pleasant or not so nice.. whatever anyone may do or say
however anyone may behave I just sit back and look at my
thoughts and gradually channelise the thoughts into a different
direction because I am the master and the creator.... I turn
the focus from outside to inside .. because I understand now
that the energy flows from inside me to everyone outside.... So I am doing everything outside but my attention is on what I am
creating inside .. because what I create inside naturally flows
outside... I am honest with myself .. honest in my thoughts
words and actions and there is absolute harmony. This is
trust... I trust myself I love myself .. because I am a pure
being... Om Shanti!
