to tell other people to change because we don't have control
over our own sanskar.
SO: But can we change the sanskars?
SS: Yes, definitely, by understanding and seeing what the

SO: How can I find the reason within me? It takes 'you'
to find it or can 'I' find it? Suppose I get angry very easily,
how do I know what kind of sanskars I have? Will I have
to go through my past?
SS: Definitely you need to see your past. Suppose someone has
had a troubled childhood- the parents were critical, physically
abusive, etc. The child always has to keep proving himself,
and still keep going through pain because of the criticism
received. Now as this child grows up, he builds a defense
mechanism. He does not want to go through the hurt and
pain, and so he becomes loud and aggressive. Before anyone
can say anything to him, he will shout at people. People will
fear him. This is a protection wall that the person builds so
that no one can ever say anything to him, but inside he is
an innocent, fearful and hurt child.
SO: He had gone through some situations that he could
not fight.
SS: Not only that, the child experienced hurt at that time.
Now the child doesn't want to get hurt again, and this will
be so even when he is 30, 40 or 50 years old. Now when this
person starts working on himself and says I will not get hurt
even if someone says something, he becomes strong inside
