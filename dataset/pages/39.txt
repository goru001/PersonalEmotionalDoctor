SO: Tell me, what is the meaning of unlimited?
Ss: That which is not dependent on any limited object, people
or situation. It's state of being is unlimited, unconditional,
and independent. It is free of dependencies and, therefore,
free of the fear of failure. Whenever there is dependency on
someone or something, the second thought instantly will be
of fear. What if I don't get it? I have immediately created
fear and as I create fear, the happiness is gone. You will find
people fearing happiness too when everyone in the house is
happy, someone will say 'don't be so happy, you never know
what's going to happen next'. They are so fearful that they are
scared to be happy today.
SO: Everything is temporary.
SS: Because it's all dependent on situations. Today the situation is
favourable, so you are happy, but you don't know what the next
situation is going to be. But, if your happiness is independent
of situations, then you can be happy 24 x 7
SO: You think we can be happy 24 x 7?
SS: It's possible and we can do it, but first we have to take care
of ourselves and take self-responsibility. But if it depends on
outside factors then it is occasional. The more the situations
become challenging; the more people's behaviours become
unpredictable. It becomes a struggle and that is why we start
accepting stress as natural, whereas it is happiness that is natural.
SO: Sister Shivani, thank you so much for explaining
how stress is not natural - happiness is. Let us do a small
meditation to collect our thoughts at this point.
