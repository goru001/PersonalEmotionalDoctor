else; and I do something else. There is disharmony and this
disharmony will then continue. Again I will think I have to
do this, but my words and actions will not follow, which will
reduce my will power. It's going to be damaging for us and
that is why our will power is low today.
SO: We understood the four types of sanskars, which
is the fifth type?
The fifth sanskar are the original sanskars. When I
understand my original sanskar, it is easy to take care of
the other four. Past birth sanskars not in my control
sanskars from family - not in my control; sanskars from the
environment not in my control; will power - in my control
I can create new sanskars through my will power but even
will power gets activated when I understand my original
sanskar, my original nature, and that's the original nature of
every human soul on this planet. Every being is originally
pure, affectionate, peaceful, blissful and powerful. Every being
has this nature and we are looking for it outside because we
have forgotten that this is my nature. Spirituality shifts our
belief from I want happiness and peace to the truth that I am
a peaceful being; I am a blissful being; I am a powerful being.
And then it becomes natural and the whole perspective
will change. If I want peace, then I am always seeking outside.
If I understand, I am peace, then I become a giver. So it ends
our looking for happiness, asking for love, and we start sharing
our peace, love and happiness with all. It automatically flows
from us to the people around us. Like when we are stressed
we don't have to consciously give it to others, all who come in
our energy field automatically receive it and are influenced
