SO: But don't you also attract such people and such
situations?
SS: We are not attracting situations, but we are responding
to situations in a similar manner as before. If there is a
challenge, since we are already emotionally low, we don't
have the power to face the situation in a proactive way. I
am already hurt about something that happened years
back, and here comes another fresh stimulus. I don't have
the strength. The pain that I will create will be much more
than what I would have created had I healed my past. Also
pain created because of one particular situation or person,
does not remain only in that relationship with that person
The pain has now become a part of my personality, and I
will tend to get hurt more easily in other relationships too.
SO: So it is link after link after link.
SS: Because it's my personality, not theirs. I can use you as
the stimulus and say I am hurt, but now its my personality
This personality will go with me to every situation and every
person. So I am vulnerable every time. It's not about changing
your job, its not about changing your partner, your friends,
your spouse; it's about making yourself stronger.
And then your immunity system, your emotional
immunity system, is strong wherever you are, with whoever
you are. It doesn't matter who and how they are.

SO: Do you think it's easy for people to change their
thoughts?
SS: People are doing miracles with their lives. They are doing it; no one else is doing it. The first realisation is - IT'S ME, NOT
