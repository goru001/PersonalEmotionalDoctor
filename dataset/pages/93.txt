MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
Self-awareness means to just watch my thoughts, to be
able to see what I am thinking and to be aware that I
am the creator of these thoughts.
. Next step is to check whether this thinking is the right
kind of thinking for me.
. We create 25 to 30 thoughts per minute that is, 40
to 50 thousand thoughts in a day. Thoughts are the
most powerful source of energy that we have, so lets
be careful about how we use them.
. There are four types of thoughts. One type of thought
is pure: powerful, positive and selfless; another type is
negative thoughts of ego and anger that create hatred
resentment, fear, rejection, or criticism.
. Next are necessary thoughts that are thoughts related
to action; these are neutral thoughts, yet they can be
pre-cursors to negative thoughts
The fourth type of thought is waste thoughts, which are
thoughts about the past or the future - both not in our
control, and so a waste of time and energy.
