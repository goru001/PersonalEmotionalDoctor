when you are upset, just stop and ask who is creating it.
I am creating it, irrespective of whatever the situation or the stimulus. The more we are aware we will understand that we
have lived all our life saying you are responsible, whereas all the
time it was we who were creating it. So that is the awakening
Now we only need to take care of how can I change what I 
am creating?
Without this understanding, we would feel powerless because
we believe people are responsible for our happiness and people
are responsible for hurting us. We would wait for people to
talk nicely to us. At the same time, hope that they will always
be nice to us. What if tomorrow they don't talk nicely to us?
Then we will not be happy. There is dependency, and hence
fear.
When we understand that everything is happening here 
in the mind, then there is no insecurity and there is no fear of
the future. So situations could be pleasant or not so pleasant,
and people could be pleasant or not so pleasant, I only have to
take care of one person and that person is me. It's very simple.
The other thing that you mentioned was about the mind
being fickle and the only way to control it is by engaging in 
good acts that are beneficial for all. Fickle means when the
mind is indecisive and inconsistent. When the mind keeps
changing, the quality of thoughts is not very nice; when we
are peaceful, the mind works slowly and cautiously. When we
are worried, the thoughts are very fast; when we are stable, the
speed is slow; when we are fearful, the thoughts gain speed.
So if my mind is fast and inconsistent, it means the quality of
energy is not right. And now we want this mind to do an act that 
is for the good of others. Benevolence is not in the act, it
is first in the energy that I send out while doing the act. Here
