weeping while she was talking about it. I asked her how
her husband's childhood had been. She said it was not
pleasant; he was a single child to working parents, who did
not have much time for him, and he had been very lonely.
What I understood was that the husband felt he had not
got love from others around him; in his wife he found one
person whom he could call his own, and the way he showed
power and control over his wife was violence. It was actually
because he was insecure and possessive, and he was in a lot
of pain inside. Now, instead of hatred she was filled with
sympathy. She said, my husband was in pain all this while,
and I thought I was the one who was in pain. This reality
changed her, and now they are healing each other. It's not
that the situation is solved in one day because the husband
says he doesn't know what happens to him. Such things
happen because of some mind block inside. It's just that
we need to be able to detach ourselves from our position,
go to their position, and see what could be the reason for
their behaviour. But what happens is when the husband does
something wrong to the wife, the wife only feels her own
hurt. She fails to understand what the husband is going
through, and vice versa.
SO: What if both of them had a bad childhood?
SS: The wife was constantly weeping. She kept telling the
husband 'promise me that you will never hit me again, only
then will I go home. The husband said 'I promise I will try'
She said 'no, give me a guarantee that you will never do it
again. So I told the lady, you guarantee that you are never
going to cry again.' She promptly said l will try. It's so easy
