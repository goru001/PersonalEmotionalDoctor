One will think 'yes, I have to achieve this by tomorrow

something happens', or 'what if I don't achieve this: So, one
has reached the destination with stability, and the other has
done the same by creating stress. The end result is externally
the same, for both have performed, but internally the other
person is totally fatigued. This other person will conveniently
put blame on the pressure, and not realise that it is his own
creation in the face of pressure.
Stress in science has a simple formula:
stress = pressure ÷ resilience
Pressure, the numerator here, includes what's coming from
outside targets, exams, relationships, situations, traffic jams,
deadlines, etc. Resilience is my inner strength to face that
pressure. Consider the simple metal sheets used in industrial
applications. Different metal sheets are subjected to the same
amount of pressure, but the stress factor of every metal is
different because every metal sheet's power to face that pressure
is different
Now in the formula stress = pressure÷ resilience, we have
conveniently ignored the denominator and embraced the
conditioning of stress = pressure.
Its ignored, because I am not ready to take responsibility
of my inner strength. Hence, for me stress = pressure. If I
have an exam, obviously I will get tensed. If my boss is very
