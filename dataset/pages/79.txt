SO: He will know that I did not like his shirt.
SS: He won't be able to catch your thoughts. We can't catch
people's thoughts. The mind needs to be really very silent
to be able to catch peoples thoughts, but we can catch the
feelings, the vibrations. That is why sometimes after meeting
people and having a polite conversation, we still feel, I don't
think they really meant what they said, they were nice to talk
to but I don't feel anything nice after they left.' The foundation
of this relationship is false, so it's no relationship at all. If
I send this conflicting energy to you, you will doubt
intentions and then you will always doubt my intention.
Then there is no trust in this relationship; one word and the
relationship is over because there was no foundation. So we
need to ask ourselves what are we doing
One option is: I don't say that you are wearing a nice shirt
if I am not convinced that it is nice. If I don't feel it's nice, I
shouldn't say it's nice; it's integrity. If at all I still want to say
it's nice, first let 'me understand that its nice, by creating
a thought: okay I might not like a white shirt but that's just
my choices your choice is nice for you. Create this thought
and then say it. I keep working on myself till my thought
and words are in harmony and then I communicate. That
is communication
SO: If I say you are wearing something nice and actually
I do not mean it, what happens to me? What am I doing
to myself, to my soul, to my personality?
SS: I am cheating myself. I am not honest to myself, what I
think, I don't do. There is disharmony between my thoughts,
words and actions; I think something else, I say something
