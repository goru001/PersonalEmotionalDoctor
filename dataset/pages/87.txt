childhood. This table is in the wrong place.
SS: This is true. I should be made to understand that the table
is where it is supposed to be; it is I who failed to see the table
while playing.
Yes, I have to understand this. Let's say my boss shouted
at me this morning. I had worked very hard; I was sincere; I
finished everything on time. But he still shouted at me. My
mind starts, 'He just doesn't respect sincerity; he doesn't know
how to appreciate and motivate his people. These thoughts are
coming to me; it is how I feel. And who is responsible for this?
It's my boss, and I am justified in thinking like this. Then I say
my boss needs to change. And there goes the self-awareness
and the inner responsibility.
SO: So if I am aware first, then I will know that I am creating
this thought towards my boss and I am also sending out
negative energy to him. Then, while sending this energy
to him, I am also creating so much negative energy within
me. So it is all give-and-take of negative energy and I am
surrounded with that.
SS: Not only that, the energy that I am creating and sending to
him is also affecting those around me. My family, with whom
I am sitting at home in the evening, is feeling that energy too
because I am creating it. You know, it's like a perfume. Like it
or not, I do get the smell of the perfume that you use. That's
why if we are under stress we automatically pass it on to our
children
SO: This reminds me of something quite interesting. When I am stressed and angry and come home in that state
