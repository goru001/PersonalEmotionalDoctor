me and my body and the people around me. For 10 minutes
I have created thoughts of pain, and in the 11th minute I say
okay, enough now, let me change but those ten minutes. That's
why there is this need for constant awareness. It happens with
practice. The 10 minutes will become 8 and 5 and 3, and then
finally it will be 'okay, this is it'. And then we will reach a stage
where we will not be creating it; we will be aware of it as soon
as we are about to create it and we will say 'okay, change'.
SO: And one day it won't get created at all.
SS: Yes, because then I have come into the consciousness of my
original self that of a pure being. We are now in the transition
stage. It's like we are sleeping and trying to wake up. We wake
up a first and say 'okay, let me sleep for five more minutes
We wake up to the truth and say I am a peaceful being; and
then we create anger once more, that is we fall asleep again.
SO: One has to believe first. If I tell somebody tomorrow
that you are a peaceful being, he will ask me what the proof
is. Is
it because everyone yearns for peace?
SS: You only yearn for that which you are. The body is made of
five elements of nature: water, air, ether, fire and earth. Whenever
there is lack of one element in the body, we immediately say
I want water' 'I want fresh air. Why do I want fresh air? Why
do I want water? Because the body is made of this and its
lacking these right now. At that time if you give me anything
else, I will say no. Similarly, I the being am made up of seven
elements: purity, peace, power, love, knowledge truth and bliss.
Every time there is a little imbalance, we say: I want peace, I
want happiness, I want love, I want power.
