SO: I will say my mind is creating the thoughts.
SS: But it's my mind, so who is creating the thoughts? I am.
Look at yourself creating those thoughts. She should have
called me; I was waiting for her call. So you sit back and just
change your thoughts gradually. She didn't feel like talking to
me at that time. It was her choice.
SO: She should be happy when she speaks to me, that's what
my mind says.
SS: Yes, because I like people to be dependent on me. I am
dependent too. It's this control that gives me power. I am empty
inside and I love this idea of people being dependent on me.
I think I am more powerful because people are dependent on
me for feeling good. Because I am dependent on other people,
I feel other people should also be dependent on me for feeling
happy; how could she be happy without talking to me because
I am not happy without talking to her? We are trapped, and
we are trapping other people into being dependent on us. And
all this is happening in the name of love and respect and trust,
which is supposed to be unconditional
SO: Thank you, Sister Shivani, you have spoken the right
words: love, trust, unconditional love. Let us have a minute
of meditation.
SS: Relax and reflect on these thoughts.
Relax and reflect on these thoughts. Meditate.
Let me look at the people around me my friends
family, and my immediate relationships.. Everyone
me at home and at work .. doing and being exactly the way
