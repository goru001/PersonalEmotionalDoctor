that's because he or she is weak; one could be very confident
and could run and get onto his lap; one will just stand in
the corner neither scared nor very confident. The father is
the same, though his nature and personality is the same.
So if one is comfortable, why are the others scared? One is
a meek personality, so he sees the same father through his
perspective.
SO: Sister Shivani, let's consider a normal couple. If a
husband is tough, the wife says can't you be nice some
time, 'can't you speak softly, 'can't you be loving', and so
on. Conversely, if a person is very loving and soft, his
wife will say'can't you be tough sometimes, look at what
that fellow said to me'. Even from your perspective, you
are not happy with one kind of role your partner plays;
you want them to play different roles all the time.
SS: Because we have created an image of the right husband.
We get into a relationship with the image of an ideal partner
and an ideal friend, and then we spend our life time trying
to change our partner into that image. Let's say my image is
that of a partner who is an extrovert, dynamic and loud. But
I have a partner who is very soft and quiet, and an introvert.
According to me, this is not how my partner should be
So it's not about how he is as an individual; it's about what
image I created in my mind. I will keep on saying this is not
how you should be, you should be loud, you should be more
open, you should be like this, you should be like that. Then
if he becomes an extrovert, I will say, not that much, a little
less. So I want the person to be exactly the way I want him
to be. It's like going to a tailor who prepares your costume
