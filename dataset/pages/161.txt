that success is wrong; just that I should have taken care of
this glass while moving towards success.
SO: But even before moving towards success we were
empty, weren't we?
SS: No, look at a child - so contented. That's whats so
attractive about the child. We teach the child that in order
to be happy he has to get more marks; in order to come first
he has to get tensed and compete with his friends. Look at
the child when the child is sleeping - such serenity.
SO: Can we meditate to sleep like a child?
SS: Relax and Reflect on these thoughts. Meditate.
Let us sit back and relax preparing myself for a good
sleep.... Let me just look at the day . everything that's passed
is past.. full stop.... However tough . however challenging
it's over.... Now is a new moment a new response
and a new feeling.... I am in control... I am pure energy....I
am already complete beautiful contented... successful.
Everything that I was looking for outside is already there in
me... The purpose of my life is not to achieve it outside but
to express it while I am moving through my goals .. I am the
complete .. perfect. pure being master of the body and
every sense organ everything in control. Om Shanti!
