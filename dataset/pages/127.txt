the centre of the forehead... the operator sitting there taking
charge of this machine .. playing roles.. relationships and
responsibilities.... I the human being doing action but as
do I express what i am... Let me look at myself driving to
work .. at office with my colleagues at home with my friends
and family with the awareness.. I am a pure being doing
things interacting with people.... and thereby expressing and
experiencing my original sanskar of peace and happiness.... Let
me see how the day will be. Om Shanti!
MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. People predicting our future are only telling us a
probability. It is only a probability, not a reality.
. We have the power to listen to the prediction and still
choose our response - that is, our thoughts and actions
and thereby create a reality based on our choice.
We always think that we need to do things outside to
change the way we feel inside. The reality is we need to
change how we feel inside to change the things outside.
. Happiness is not something that we should expect to
get from other people - it is to be created within and
shared with people we meet.
. We are not 'human doings' doing things to be at peace;
we are 'human beings' at peace and doing things.
