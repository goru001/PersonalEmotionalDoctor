we created in that one hour of wait? We sent vibrations to the
other person and spread it to everyone around us in that one
hour, and then we say isn't it natural. No, this is not natural
Natural is he has not reached; I am not being able to contact
him, and the situation is not in my control. Let us always see
immediately what is in my control and what is not. If the
situation is in my control, take charge; but if the situation is
out of my control then there is only one thing in my control,
it is the quality of my thinking.
SO: But tell me one thing: why is it easier to create a negative
thought rather than a positive one?
SS: You just have to fill in a different quality of information. It's
as simple as that. When I change the quality of the information
coming in, the thoughts change, the way I respond changes,
and my destiny changes. I have a choice. When the newspaper
comes in the morning, I have a choice as to what time I will
read it. So let's just postpone it; let's take this one resolve today.
There will be a big change. Postpone the newspaper and the
television news to the later part of the day and substitute it with 
something very pure and powerful. A simple change to
your morning diet for the mind will make all the difference
So one positive thing in the morning, and one positive thing
just before going to sleep is the remedy. What do we take in
before going to sleep? Television serials? A horror movie?
That's the last layer of information going with us. It will affect
the quality of our thoughts during the night. The first layer
of information in the morning influences our thoughts during
the day. The last information before we go to sleep influences the quality of our thoughts at night.
