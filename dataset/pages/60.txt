someone else I say 'can I have a glass of water, please? Which
one of these two is my original nature? It's just that when
we are with our spouse, we do not have the responsibility of
pleasing them; we take them for granted.
SO: Which one is artificial then?
SS: I have to ask myself.
SO: You mean she will feel nice if I speak in the same way
to her?
SS: More important is that you will feel nice if you speak that
way to her. Our behaviour is not for other people; it is first
for us. Will I speak sweetly to you so that you are happy? No,
I will speak sweetly because it makes me feel nice.
SO: Since childhood I have been watching my sisters, brothers,
relations, everybody doing something or the other only for
the outside world.
SS: That is good. But let's add just one criterion here: taking
care of myself first and doing for others what I feel comfortable
doing. There are a lot of people who are doing things for
others and when they do not get something back in return,
they sit back and say, I did so much and what did I get in
return nothing. So, should I be doing it because I want
something in return?
SO: Suppose you get only criticism in return. How will you feel?
SS: First of all, I need to check how I was feeling while doing
it. Nice. That's about it! Now if I get criticism, I just check
whether the criticism is true.
