be no stress, so we give 10% responsibility to the pressure. The
remaining 90% is about the extent I take charge of how I am
going to handle that pressure.
SO: So, how I react to something is 90%. Somebody just hits
my car if it's an old car, I don't really get that upset; but
if it's a brand new one, I react. What do you say?
SS: How you react is your choice. Someone has hit your car
- the situation was not in your control. Now, you have two
ways to respond: 1) Get out of the car, create a scene, shout
at him, hit him, abuse him, have him respond in the same
manner, and have ten more people in the scene, or 2) wish
him good morning and a nice day
SO: And the other choice is to just smile and say it's okay.
In any case your car is insured.
SS: Yes! More important is the insurance of the mind. You
claim insurance and your car is repaired. But for the damage
that gets done inside you every time a situation arises, where
is the insurance for that and where are the repairs?
SO: I am more concerned that my car is damaged.
SS: The car is more important than my happiness on my
responsibility list, because I thought the car was my source of
happiness. Only when I make my state of being as my priority
will I start taking care of myself. First check if you are okay,
then check if everything outside of you is okay.
SO: If you don't help yourself, how can you help others?
