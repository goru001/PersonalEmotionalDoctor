Thoughts and words are different. So when we say we are
family and we are friends and we are there for each other, let
it not be just in words. There should be harmony between
thoughts and words, and that's the simplest thing to take
care of in relationships. Let there be no conflict between
what we are thinking and what we are saying. When there
is a difference, there is also a conflict in the energy that the
opposite person receives. Remember, that the thought energy
travels faster.
SO: Don't you think today's world is like this? We say
'wow, you are wearing such a nice shirt' Inside we are
thinking 'he doesn't have taste'
Ss: Why did we say 'wow, you are wearing a nice shirt?
SO: A lot of people talk like that. We pick it up from
everyone around us.
SS: But why do I say to you that your shirt is very nice?
SO: To please people.
SS: To please people. This is extremely important. We are
saying it to make people happy. Now, happiness is not words
happiness is energy, it is vibrations, it is feelings. I am sending
a word out by paying a compliment to your shirt, and I am
also sending other thoughts saying horrible shirt, horrible
choice, no taste at all. So what's the total energy that comes
to you? In fact vibration reaches faster and is much more
powerful than the words.
