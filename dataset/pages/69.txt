Just One Thought Away
SO: I read somewhere that peace and happiness almost
go hand-in-hand. The writer says there is peace in the
smile of a child, in the tender touch of one's mother;
it has got nothing to do with God or religion but
everything to do with the state of one's mind
SS: Absolutely. In both the instances, the author is talking
about the vibrations of the being. The smile of the child
emanates vibrations of purity and innocence, and the touch
of the mother has vibrations of love and unconditional
acceptance. When we experience these gestures, more than
the act, it is the vibration in the energy that we experience
and that's why there is peace. And wherever there is peace,
there will be happiness
SO: So the mother and the child are so natural. For elders
you have to make an effort.
That's what it's all about; about making it natural. The effort
