whatever I have understood, I will have to put in a little effort
at applying it. Now I have understood that anger is unnatural
that it is a response I create; so when I come to my workplace
or spend time with my family, I will have to take care that
I do not react the next time someone does something that
according to me is not right.
SO: You remind me of my Guru. I used to ask her about the
way to attain peace, but did not get a direct answer. I was
someone who did not know the meaning of peace. Waiting
for the lift, I used to keep pressing the button till it reached
me. I was a restless man all the time and I said I wanted
peace. Your words remind me of that line she said, 'you
ask me every time about peace, but do you do any karmas
of peace?' I could not relate to what she was saying. When
I went outside I saw that somebody had parked his car in
front of mine. I wanted to kick that car. I opened my car
door and wanted to honk, and I remembered what she had
said inside, about doing karmas of peace.
SS: I want peace but I think it has to come from outside.
Similarly, I want happiness, I want love, and so on. Want
means that someone, somewhere has to do something so that
I will get it. On the other hand, spirituality teaches us that I
am peace. I have to be at peace while I am doing everything.
I am a blissful being; I am a love-full being.
SO: But if I am, then why do I want?
SS: Because I have forgotten that I am. It's like the keys in your
pocket or the spectacles on your head. You may be looking
for them everywhere and even get others to join you in that
