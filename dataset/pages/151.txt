create, will get recorded. People say we remember the past
because we have to learn from the past, but what do we have
to learn from the past? We just have to check the way we
responded and learn if there was a more comfortable way of
responding. There is nothing to learn from the situation, we
only have to learn from our response. Holding on to things,
not letting them go, accumulating, it is only going to cause
pain. It's like you are holding on to something; the weight
of the object remains the same but the longer we hold it, the
more the hand is going to hurt.
SO: Hurt! People get constant headaches, skin diseases,
and no doctor knows what's happening.
SS: Because they are holding on to it. Remember, it's over.
It's the past, not in my control.
SO: What should one do? Suppose something very sad
has happened in my past and it comes to my mind. A
friend comes and asks what the matter is, and I share
with him about what took place in the past.
SS: That's what is meant by opening everyone's Band-Aid
together and scrubbing on the wounds. We went through so
much of pain but when we think about it again, we experience
the same pain all over again. So we need to ask our self: how
many times am I going to go through the same emotions
again and again? More importantly anything done repeatedly
becomes my personality, and then I carry that personality
with me everywhere. We may not discuss the past situation
with everyone, but because it's in our mind it will be part of
our vibrations.
