It's courtesy that you switch off your mobile. So it's not the
ringtone that irritates me; it's the thoughts that I create
in response to the ringtone that irritate me. The ringtone
is just a trigger. I have to realize what is disturbing me. It is
my own thoughts. My thought is that they should be polite
enough to switch off the phone. Now I change my thought
it's their choice, whether they want to switch it off or
and I respect their choice.

SO: I used to get disturbed even if somebody walked in
front of me while I was acting my scene. Now I can see
so many people moving around, and now I am learning
to accept it
SS: Now this is where we are creating the fourth type of
sanskar. Getting irritated was one of the past sanskars,
whether it came from the past birth, or from the current
environment. With awareness we can change our sanskar.
This is creating sanskars with our own will power. So we
cannot keep blaming - oh, I can't help it, this must be a past
sanskar. It's all about awareness.
SO: You are saying that awareness will bring will power.
SS: Yes. It's will power that I will use to create a new sanskar
See, every time I say 'this is because of you'; I am getting
irritated because of this'; I imply that I am not powerful and
others can overpower me. Will power means I have the power
to choose, to think and be and do what I want. Every time I
use that power, it's will power. Many times we feel we don't
have will power. Everyone has power, everyone has the same
amount of will power; it just depends on how much we are
