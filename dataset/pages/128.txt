Everything Happens Here
(In the Mind)
SO: Sister Shivani, I was reading, 'What comes first: peace
or happiness? Can you be at peace if you are not happy? Do
you get happiness from external factors or from within? The
mind is fickle like a fast galloping horse and the only way
to control it is by involving it in good actions beneficial for
all' I need your help to understand this
SS: "The quotation says - "When you are at peace, you will be
happy depending on what your idea of happiness is, whether
you get it from outside or from inside.' Let us stop and check
what outer happiness is. It's not outer happiness - it's an outer
stimulus which I use to create happiness for myself.
So: I like the way you say, 'I create happiness'; emphasis
always on our creation, you never say, 'it gives me happiness'
SS: At every step, when you are happy, when you are hurt
