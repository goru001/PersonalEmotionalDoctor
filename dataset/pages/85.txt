will concentrate on a point of light and say 'no thoughts
- no thoughts - no thoughts. 'I don't have to think' is also a
thought.
It can never happen. The mind can never stop thinking
We are trying to do something that is not natural. That's why I
say I am feeling very heavy here. There is too much of pressure
here because I have tried to suppress something. It's not natural
SO: So much pressure to stop thinking that you are going
to get up tired and disappointed
SS: Exactly. I have not been able to achieve it and then I say
I tried meditation but couldn't do it. It happens with many
people. There is so much going on in the mind, it is like a
car that is in the fifth gear and I suddenly want to bring it
down to neutral. I am trying to do it in one go. What's going
to happen? I get a jerk
SO: Sister, shall we go back a little? You said be aware - okay,
I start being aware. Then what happens? I just honestly want
to know what happens practically.
SS: Practically, the first thing that happens is knowledge
SO: You said be aware - okay, I start being aware. Then what
happens? Now I am aware that I am speaking to you. This
is my thought and my question. So now that I am aware of
my thought, what next?
SS: First thing is to be aware that I am creating this thought.
A very common illusion is that the thought is coming to me
because of some stimulus. You know, a lot of people use this
language: 'that thought just came to me'. What does it mean?
