after eight years; the question is what was the quality of the
mind for those eight years? Your acquaintance created this
thought that maybe the other person who took the money
needed it badly and was needy; he even blessed the person
saying that may he have much more; in other words he was
at peace. The other option for him was to harbour hatred,
resentment and revenge for eight years. He would still get back
the money after eight years, but in those years he would have
done so much damage to himself that the money would not
be able to repair it

an energy that I am feeding to my own mind... Let me stop
and ask myself who is the one who is hurting me who
is the one who is creating the pain . I have a choice.. I the 
pure and peaceful being .. the actor playing so many different
roles with other actors.. each one playing their role.. I the 
actor remember my true personality.. the pure being .
play every act and every role with the awareness of my original
personality.. Look at yourself... that pure being as the parent
