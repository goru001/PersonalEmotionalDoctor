the goal, I can plot anything against you to get you out of the
way. I may even compromise on my values. Suppose during
my journey you tell me that if I am honest I'll have to stop
here for one week, but if I tell a lie I can go there faster. Now,
many of us wouldn't even think twice before using the other
method. I might end up telling a lie and that's where I will
compromise on my values and principles during my journey.I
have begun to think that my values and principles are delaying
my process of attaining my happiness.
SO: But if you are going to get happiness, how does it matter
if you were to lie?
SS: At this moment we are still on the journey; we haven't
reached the destination yet. While on the journey, I am creating
anger and stress, and I am compromising on my values and
principles. So, I am creating negative emotions in the course of
my journey. For six months I create anxiety and stress, which
in turn can disturb my relationships and create issues with
people at work. My inner state of mind will be in an upheaval,
and eventually it will start affecting my physical health. Finally
after six months when I reach my goal, how will I feel?
SO: Don't you think you will be happy?
SS: If I have created all these negative emotions on the way I
have experienced and have also transmitted the same emotions
to everyone around me; all this happened on the journey. It's
like I have fallen down, hurt myself, and then reached there
By the time I reached there, I am totally in pain. But because
I have reached there I am very happy. Now my conditioning
says happiness is dependent on achievement
