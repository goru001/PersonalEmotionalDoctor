thing happening and my reaction. In that split second
will I remember that I should not react like this? I
used to see, many Guru, there would be a huge explosion during
Diwali and his eye would not even blink. How do
we reach that stage?
SS: It comes with attention and practice. Earlier if I was
conducting a workshop and somebody's mobile phone rang,
I would get disturbed. There I was talking to the gathering
about stability, but inside I was disturbed.
S0: So it was one step leading to another? Earlier you were
disturbed, another time you must have said, 'it's okay,
they are like that' Next time, you are not even bothered
if they are 'like that' or not; it really doesn't matter to
you. It doesn't distract you anymore. Aren't these the
stages then? One has to go through stages; one cannot
go straight to your stage.
SS: Some people will say 'it's going to take years and years.
No, it doesn't take years, it's just one thought of awareness
otherwise I can get irritated by a mobile phone for a lifetime.
We can live our lives getting irritated by the mobiles that are
ringing around us.
SO: What is the meaning of one thought of awareness?
SS: One thought is 'How can I allow one unimportant
ringtone to disturb my mind?' This is just one thought.
I don't think about the opposite person because it is not the
ringtone that disturbs us; it's the thoughts that I create
alter listening to the ringtone. Why did they not switch off their
mobiles? Don't they know that they are in a public programme?
