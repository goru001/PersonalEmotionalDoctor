First, I Will Take Care of Myself
SO: I have been speaking to a few friends and they mentioned
something called the u-stress meaning good stress. They
say we need that kind of stress and tension. One of my
friend's claims that he actually waits till he is stressed and
time is less, because then he works best. How should one
understand that?
SS: It's a belief system. It is something that we are hearing
everywhere around us that unless there is stress I will
not perform; if there is no stress I will become passive and
laidback. They call it the drive to perform, to achieve. So we
need to ask ourselves: is it really true? For that I need to ask
myself what is this stress and how do I feel when I experien
it. Imagine that I suddenly have a problem in my knee and it
starts paining, I am still walking but is it the same as I was
walking before, when everything was fine?
