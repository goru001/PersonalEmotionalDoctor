MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. If other people are behaving in a reactive manner, at
that time for me to remain stable internally, is strength
and hence peace is strength not weakness.
Anger is not strength.It is a sign that I have lost control
.
of myself. Even hurt, resentment, are silent forms of
anger, and damage me of the creator.
My every THOUGHT is followed by a FEELING. So if
I am not feeling nice, I have to stop and check - what
have I been thinking
My feelings  a period of time, created on the basis
on my thoughts, develop my ATTITUDE- about people,
situations, work or about the world.
My attitude comes out into ACTION. Any action done
repeatedly becomes my HABIT. All my habits put
together is my PERSONALITY. At every step in life
this PERSONALITY determines my DESTINY.
I the being am an embodiment of 7 qualities - Purity,
Peace, Love, Bliss, Knowledge, Power and Truth.
