SO: How does one get there?
SS: One gets there by understanding that physical comfort is

internal comfort - the internal stability that we call happiness,
but I thought that if I am physically comfortable, then that
means I will be happy. Today, we have started to buy happiness
If I buy this, this and this the list is never-ending I will be
happy. This doesn't mean that we don't buy those things, rather
let's not associate them with our being happy. I generally buy
a thing because it's useful, it's comfortable or it's productive
But is it happiness? No!
At least I know why I am buying something; and I don't
tell my mind that when I buy this I will be happy. If I associate
material things with happiness then I am postponing my
happiness and putting a new condition to it. Let's suppose
that I am building a new house and I tell myself that when
this house is built and I shift there, then I will be happy. This
could mean after a year or after two years.
So, again I am postponing my happiness until a future time.

is married and has a family. But soon, he feels that he will
be very happy when his children are settled. Few years down
the line, the children are settled and everything is fine. What
