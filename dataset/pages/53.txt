they think is right Their behaviour and their words are the
stimulus thats coming from outside I, the being, choose my
response My response is not automated... it's not in their
control... it's my choice Let me look at myself with them
they are behaving in a manner that I think is not right...
Now let me look at myself. in control...in charge not of
them not of the situation but of my state of mind I am
creating the right thought at the right time . I am the master
an independent
powerful being. Om Shanti
MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. Our belief systems decide our way of living; we need to
experiment with what we are learning in order to
to
change our old belief systems
.
. I don't want peace. I am peace. Now I will be at peace and do things outside.

Try a new belief system. Experiment with it. When you experience the result, it becomes the truth

Every act I do, I will do it with the awareness that I
am a peaceful being.

Unlimited Happiness is not dependent on people, objects
or situations; no one can make me happy and I can't
make others happy, till they want it themselves.
