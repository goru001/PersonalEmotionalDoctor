SO: And for how long will this kind of mood and the
agitation remain?
SS: Let's say I have to drive for about half an hour to work. So
the mood will stay with me for about half an hour. However, the
unfortunate part is, within the next half an hour, there will be
another situation. By that time my emotional immunity system
is already low and the chances of me reacting has increased.
Next I reach my office and my receptionist is not there on her
desk.... She has not come to office on time. Now yet another
situation confronts me. I go to my desk and see that the office
boy has not cleaned my table properly. One more situation. My
junior has not completed his work, which was supposed to be
there on my desk at 10 o' clock in the morning. So, situation
after situation unfolds, and I keep reacting. Every time I justify
my reaction by saying it is because of....

SO: ...this, this, this. I am right, I didn't do anything but
this happened, and it is natural.
SS: If you react, you are wasting and depleting your energy;
you are reducing your emotional strength. When you encounter
the next situation you will be weaker than before.
SO: Over a period of time it also becomes a habit. Then
you get high blood pressure and heart problems start an
so on. It takes a toll on our health.
SS: Today we say high blood pressure is natural because the
stress is natural, and the by-product of this stress will also
be natural. So everything that was unnatural gets labelled as
natural. And then we say we want happiness
