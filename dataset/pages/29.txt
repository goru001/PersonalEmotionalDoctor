. If we believe that happiness is experienced after
achievement, then we create stress, anger and fear
while trying to achieve it. Thus we ultimately do not
experience happiness.
Before I take responsibility of those around me, I need
to take responsibility for my own thinking and feelings.
When I am happy and take care of others, then they
will be happy.
You cannot make your child emotionally strong without
being emotionally strong yourself
