for everything that I am doing the whole day, my whole life, if
I am emotionally healthy, then whatever I do will be beautiful
So: So how should we be emotionally healthy?
SS: That's an important aspect. It's important to understand
that this is an aspect of my life which we have taken for
granted, which we thought will happen on its own; which we
thought other people will take care of. We always thought - I
am supposed to make you happy and you are supposed to
make me happy.
SO: So often I have heard people saying 'when I get married
I will be very happy, I am tired of my mother, brothers and
sisters.' As it turns out, they are not happy when they get
married also and it's back to square one. That's why I asked
you this question: how and what to do to be emotionally
balanced and stable and to be happy in almost all conditions?
SS: There are people who are not happy in their marriages and
looking for relationships outside their marriage
SO: Then they break that as well and go to the third one.
SS: Because we thought happiness has to come from the other
person. So we kept searching.
SO: So finally we come to the conclusion that happiness
cannot come from outside at all. We have been working so
hard in the wrong direction. We went to temples, we did
social work, went shopping, watched movies, parties, alcohol
each time we only wanted to be happy. Now we have to work
the other way round.
