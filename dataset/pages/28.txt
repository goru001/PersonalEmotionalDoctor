have to be emotionally strong. Let us do a little meditation
here Sister Shivani.
SS: So it's time to do that now. While taking care of our
children we always need to remember, we can send our child
to the best school without having gone to school ourselves.
We can ensure that our children eat well, even if we sleep
empty stomach. But it is not possible to make our children
happy without being happy ourselves. You cannot make your
child emotionally strong without being emotionally strong
yourself, so that's where the responsibility comes to find it
first in yourself.
SS: Relax and reflect on these thoughts:
Let us sit back and look at the journey of our life aims,
objectives, achievements... milestones to cover. that is my
journey... Let me look at myself on the journey the traveller
with the changed consciousness. Happiness is not at the
destination happiness is my state of being on the journey. I
am happy... stable .. in control.. powerful while I am on
the journey... There are obstacles on the way but my first
responsibility is to take care of my state of being of the way
I respond. . This is my responsibility. Om Shanti!
MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. Happiness is a state of being: created while working
towards the goal, not a feeling to be experienced after
achieving the goal.
