MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. Every time we think of the past, we are making it the
present because we are creating the same emotions
again.
. The past is passed. Full stop. Let it not repeat in the
mind; when you do, it is like rubbing a wound and
therefore not allowing it to heal.
There is nothing to learn from the situation that
happened. The only thing I need to learn is whether
had the choice of responding in another manner.
The only thing I need to learn from the past is whether
I had the choice of responding in another manner.
. Holding on to the past -  not letting go - will only
create pain within. The situation is the same but the
longer we hold on to it, the pain increases.
. In relationships, no one is ever wrong; each one is right
from their own perspective. Detaching from my own
perspective and understanding the other's perspective
is empathy.
. While working towards our achievements, if we
care not to compromise on our values of peace, love
and happiness, we will be always contented.
