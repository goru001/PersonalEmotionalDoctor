power of those around us, especially our children. Let's say
your child spends too much time on the Internet and you
tell him that from tomorrow he is going to be on it only for
an hour. Your words are affirmative, but your thoughts are
of doubt and failure in giving up the addiction.
SO: Internally I am so sure that my child will not be
able to do it.
SS: Every thought that I create is the energy that I am
showing or radiating to the child
SO: But why should the child get disturbed by the energy
of the parent?
SS: We get influenced by the thoughts, words and actions
of other people. We have to be very strong and protected
and that can happen if we practice not getting influenced
by the energy around us. Right now we are quite vulnerable.
So everything thats happening around us creates an impact.
We should take care of ourselves and the people around us,
if someone is trying to do something, do not create a single
thought of doubt or negativity. If we create thoughts of
doubt and fear for the child, we disempower the child. Let
us create only powerful thoughts, you can do it, we have
faith in you.' Even if the child does not have the power, he
will get empowered by the parents and succeed. Today in
the corporate sector they are saying we motivate our people.
Motivation will not happen with words. Your subordinate is
late every day; you motivate him by saying I am sure you
will do it. But your thinking is 'I know him, he is not going
to come on time; he will always be like this.
