But isn't this being a bit selfish?
SS: If I don't take care of myself, can I help you? All my time
and energy is spent in taking care of other people. What's the
result? Today I am under stress, and so are my children. Earlier,
depression was something that affected people when they were
60 and above; today we have school children with so many
issues and are frequenting counsellors and psychiatrists. If we
were fulfilling our responsibilities, this wouldn't be the result.
So: We often say that the teachers are irresponsible, the
politicians are irresponsible, but thinking inwards I am the
most irresponsible person especially by not being responsible
for myself.
SS: First I have to be responsible. The ability to respond is
responsibility. My ability to respond in every situation is response + ability = responsibility
Imagine the irony of life - we are always trying to control
things that are not in our control, while ignoring the one
thing that is in our control. We say, 'oh, my mind is not in my
control, but that is the only thing that is in one's control. Going
back to the matter of two cars bumping into each other - if
you suggest to people that you can just say okay, never mind
and drive away, they might not agree. They strongly feel that
it is important to get out of the car and shout at the one who
made the mistake. You try and explain to them that it will be
damaging for them, that is they will be hurting themselves.
They will say but what about making the other person realise
their mistake.
