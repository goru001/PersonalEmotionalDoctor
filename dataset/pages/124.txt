other come what may - north, east, south, west and then
we actually can get along. We can then get along even in the
wrong direction of the house. And if we cannot get along, then
we cannot do so even in the best designed house. It's about
the mind ready to take the challenge. We cannot always keep
changing everything outside; okay, I can change the house.
can I change you? I can only change the way I think.
SO: But they will give you good examples of how this
direction has got energy
SS: Because it's science; there is no doubt about that. But there
is a science, an energy that is much higher than the energy
of alphabets, numbers and planets. It is my own energy, the
energy of consciousness.
SO: Am I not weak here, when I use some other energy? I
have a much stronger energy within me?
SS: I can't take charge of my mind, so I take charge of everything
else outside. What time I should begin my business; in which
direction should my office be; which stone should I wear;
which symbol should be put in my office. I can just take care
of everything around me because I don't have the power to
take care of my thoughts.
SO: I have the bigger power here within and I am going
with a begging bowl to smaller powers.
SS: The weaker we become, the more we will go outside. The 
lesser control I have on myself, the more my power is reducing 
because I am not taking care. If you don't discipline your child 
at the right time, he will get spoilt eventually.
