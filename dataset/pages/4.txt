what they want in life, they often say 'success'. Why they want
success is primarily because it makes them happy. You ask
someone why they want to buy a particular thing. The most
likely response is that it makes them happy or maybe it makes
the family happy. Again you ask someone what they get out
of a relationship? Yet again, the response is often Happiness.
So, finally everyone is looking for that one word - happiness.
SO: But is happiness limited or unlimited? It is limited,
isn't it?
SS: It is. In fact, I don't even know whether it's there
SO: So it is momentary - like a child who plays with a
toy and breaks it, and then wants to try another one, then
another one, and so on. So what are we looking for actually?
If we are looking for happiness, shouldn't it be something
concrete and permanent?
SS: It should be permanent, that's most important. If happiness
is something that I like, if it's something that I desire, and if
comes naturally to me, then it won't be dependent on anything
else outside. If it's dependent on something, then it can never
be constant.
Simply put, if you are looking for it outside somewhere
then you are dependent on that thing and the feeling won't
sustain. Lets say I feel good if the weather is pleasant; my
feeling good is then dependent on the weather
SO: Sure! But what I want to understand is that how can
one have happiness without desires and dependency?
SS: That's probably one of the oldest belief systems we have
