SO: So there is no need to go to anyone for getting my
locker opened, for developing my powers.
SS: If we go somewhere, somebody out there could be
instrumental in telling us how to open it, but finally no one
else can open it for us. No one can activate the will power
for us; that someone can only help us realize that we have
this power. A simple example is when we want to give up
our addictions. Someone may want to give up alcohol,
cut down their TV watching time, or Internet surfing. We
create a powerful positive thought,
Today I will watch TV only for an hour.' We are aware
of this positive thought we create, but we are not aware of so
many negative thoughts we create immediately, It is difficult
for me .. I love watching TV.. I have tried many times
but I always fail. 
It's my habit. Can't go in one day .. Obviously
it will take time. Now we created one positive thought to
empower ourselves, and then followed by so many negative
thoughts which will disempower us. Once you have decided
to do something, just create one single thought and start
working on it.
SO: If we all have the same will power, then how is it
that some are able to give up their addictions sooner
than others.
SS: Everyone has equal will power because everyone is a powerful
being; realizing my own will power depends on how much
am aware that I am a powerful being and how much I use it
Of course, the people around me also make a difference
You know, we are largely responsible for reducing the will
