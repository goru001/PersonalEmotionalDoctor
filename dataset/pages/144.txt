want to understand why you are upset. And the wonderful
part is when we understand how our mechanism works
understanding others becomes easy. If I am hurt I will
immediately be able to realize that I am hurt; I understand
the reason and check my attitude, now it's up to me how
much time I want to remain like that. If I am jealous, I will
immediately come to know that I am jealous. Now if I see
someone who is upset, I can go beyond the visible hurt to see
what must be happening inside for them to behave like this.
It becomes easier to be with people; you don't look only at
the criticism, you look at the dynamics inside this person's
mind for them to be so critical. So we just have to understand
our mechanism - then we can understand everyone else's.
SO: This remind me of an incident that happened in
the society where I live. One of the neighbours was
angry, shouting at everybody and ready to fight. I told
one of my friends, also a neighbour, that this person's
behaviour was obnoxious and that I could not stand
it. You know, this is what she said: 'what about him,
poor chap, look at what he must be undergoing! He
must be in some kind of pain to behave like that.' Now
I understand what she meant. Understanding others
is very difficult. If my wife's behaviour changes, I never
ask her if something is wrong. I just get irritated and
leave her alone to manage it herself. Why couldn't I ask
her if she needed any help?
SS: This is withdrawal. When we can't handle other peoples
temperaments, we withdraw. Even if it is temporary, even if it
is for one hour, when the other person is in pain we withdraw.
