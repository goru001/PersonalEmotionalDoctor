should I do? I asked, what do you want? She said, I want
everything to be back to normal.
SO: That's what she always wanted.
SS: Yes. And today it's more than four years since that episode.
They have a lovely daughter too. All the effort was made by
her. The knowledge that we learn at Brahma Kumaris and
the simplicity with which it can be implemented, can be
adopted by everyone. It's only that they have to take up the
challenge; it's a little extra effort initially.
SO: Did you feel a sense of failure when the husband
was leaving the next day and they did not patch up?
SS: It was not a failure. We were not looking at the situation;
we were only concerned about her being able to take charge of
her own state of mind. Situations are not in our control. We
expect that spirituality or religion will change our problems.
No, they won't. Problems are going to come, challenges are going
to come, obstacles are going to come; spirituality gives me the
power to take charge of myself and then face the situation.
SO: But when she was creating the thoughts that
everything is fine, she was trying to change the situation.
SS: She was changing her thoughts
SO: By changing the situation in her imagination.
SS: It's not imagining. Everything is fine here (in my mind);
it's here first. I have to be okay; everything is fine.
