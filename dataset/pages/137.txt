MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. People say when angry, count one to ten; these are
external measures to postpone our reactions. However,
if we take care of our thoughts we will not create even
the thought of anger.
Our thoughts are created based on our past experiences
and the information that we take in through our sense
organs.
.During the first few hours in the morning, the power of
the mind to absorb information is very high. We need to
take care of the quality of information we take in then.
To protect ourselves from creating negative thoughts, we
need to avoid newspapers or news channels or anything
that has some disturbing information to offer early in
the morning.
. Let me try a new way of living, to be able to create
pure, powerful, positive thoughts naturally. Let me begin
the day with a few minutes of reading or listening to
pure and pleasant information
. The last layer of information at night influences the
quality of my thoughts while sleeping. So let's finish the day with a few minutes of reading or listening to pure and pleasant information.
