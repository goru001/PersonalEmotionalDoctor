The method may be different but everyone is looking for
the same things because those are what each one of us is made
of. I can be using anger as a tool but I am never comfortable
when I am angry. Anger is not my nature; anger is an acquired
sanskar, an acquired personality trait.
SO: Probably that is why we like a peaceful person, a peaceful
being. We like to sit with a saint, and feel at peace in a
particular temple or shrine, or under a tree.
SS: Because we have come closer to our natural self. We go
to a scenic place to see the sunrise or the sunset, to feel nice
Stuck in the middle of a traffic jam, we don't feel nice. Why?
Chaos is not our natural self. A place or person or a situation
that makes us feel closer to what we actually are, makes us
feel nice as well.
SO: So all these seven elements are me and this is the proof
that whenever I am at peace I am happy. How does one get
the battery recharged for all these seven elements?
SS: Try to understand the process completely. Now I am
changing my thought from 'I want peace' to 'I am peace'.
Thought changes, feeling will change, attitude will change.
and action will change. Now my actions will not be focussed
on seeking peace, because now I know that I am peace. My
actions will be coming from my discovered nature of peace.
Any action repeated a number of times becomes a habit.
All my habits put together make up my overall personality. So
who I am today, the personality is a package of every thought
we create. Personality development programmes teach us to
talk like this, smile like this, say hello like this and so on,
