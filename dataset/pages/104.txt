MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
.If we change our thoughts, our words and actions too
will change. Hence, personality transformation begins
with our thoughts.
.When we interact with people, let us interact with the
soul, the pure being, rather than the acquired body,
positions and achievements. When we talk through the
consciousness of our acquired labels, then it is the ego
of one talking to the ego of the other.
In any situation, we are playing our role along with so
many actors. Let us stop writing their script because
they are not in our control. Instead let us write only
our script. When we keep thinking of what others are
doing, we are only depleting our own energy.
