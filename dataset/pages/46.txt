SO:I just keep on at this like a mantra.' I am a peaceful being.
I am a peaceful being. A peon comes and says something
that disturbs me and I shout shut up: Again, I am angry
Then I start the mantra again, I am peaceful being
SS: It's not a mantra, it's a conviction. I am telling myself who
I am and then preparing myself. Everything that I do will
be out of this consciousness. This is who I am. It's a simple
thing. Let us say there is a space here in the mind. I think it
is empty and say I want happiness, I want peace and I want
love. I go to everyone expecting that they will fill my space.
Please do this so that I will be happy. Please talk to me nicely
so that I will be peaceful. This is one way of living life; this is
one belief system. The other belief system is that my space is
full but now I have to go through the whole day taking care
that its contents don't spill out. That's all - it's full but I have
to take care of it. This is the journey; this is what Awakening
is all about. It is about understanding
that this is who I am, that now I am peaceful. I just have to
remember that while I am talking to you its contents should
not spill out.
SO: I am peaceful. The moment I am not peaceful, it spills
out?
SS: One way is: I do this so that I will be happy. The other
way is: I am happy and now I will do this.
SO: I am happy and I will try to make you happy too.
SS: I don't know whether I will be able to make other peopie
happy because that is another deep-rooted belief system.
