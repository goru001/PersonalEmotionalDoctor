one of them... interacting through the core of my personality

MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
There is only one person who knows me well and thats
my own self.
Be 'in-dependent': dependent only on that one who is
inside; because outside things will change and they have
a reason for changing.
Our thoughts are created based on past experiences, the
information we take in and most important our belief
systems
.
Its important to take charge of how we feel, instead
of being dependent on others. To be INDEPENDENT
means to be dependent only on the one inside.
Let us be ourselves and not keep changing our behaviour
according to the way others behave with us.
