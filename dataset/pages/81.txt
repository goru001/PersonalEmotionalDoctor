Similarly by being in our natural state of peace and
happiness, we don't have to give it, it will naturally radiate and
be felt by family and friends. Energy is like an infection
we catch it from the people around us.
SO: Thank you, Sister Shivani. You have told us something
beautiful: I am peace. I am love. I am knowledge. I am bliss.
MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITEID

Our personality is a combination of five types of
sanskars - personality traits.

Some sanskars we get from our parents and other family
members. We call these hereditary sanskars because
we are within the influence of their vibrations.

There are sanskars we create because of our environment
our nationality, religion, culture and friends.

A very important set of sanskars are those that we carry
from our past birth. Our soul carries its personality
traits created in one costume to the next costume.

We create the fourth type of sanskars through our
own will power. Everyone has the same amount of
will power; it just depends on realising that we have
will power and then using it favourably.

The fifth set of sanskars are the original sanskars of every
every
soul, these being purity, peace, love, bliss, knowledge
power and truth.
