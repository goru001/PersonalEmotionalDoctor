search. 'Come on, everyone, look for my keys. Where are my
keys?' You look for it everywhere except where they actually are.
SO: How does one realize or even begin to understand that
I am peace? How do you prove this?
SS: By experimenting. Everything is a belief, we experiment
with it, and if we get the result, we take it as the truth. Keep
searching for peace, for thats the purpose of life'. If the purpose
of life is to keep searching for peace, then when will we find it?
But now we understand this is our nature. Let me experiment
a peaceful being. Now I will use this awareness in every
act that I do, with every person I meet. Every interaction I have
today, I will only remember that I am the one who is doing
it. Think of a doctor. He knows he is a doctor, so if someone
meets with an accident while he is there on the road, he will
immediately get into the healing job. But if the doctor forgets
that he is a doctor, even if there are people dying around him
he won't do anything because he has forgotten he is a doctor. So
healing won't come into action. But the minute he remembers
again that I am a doctor, he will start healing. So it's about
remembrance. I am a peaceful being was forgotten. Because it
was forgotten, I was looking for peace outside. Now try a new
belief system. Try - it's still not the truth, it's only a belief Just
experiment with it. If we get the result, then it is the truth.
SO: How will you experiment?
SS: I go back to work today and find that there is a situation.
I just remind myself that I am a peaceful being and then act.
