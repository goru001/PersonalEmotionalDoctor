MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
. My response to people should be based on my
personality, not on the behaviour of others.
The way we think and behave, is not for other people.
It is first for ourselves because we are the first ones to
experience it.
Let us take charge of our mind, instead of trying to
control others and thinking that if they change then
my mind will be in control.
.Let us choose how we want to think, feel and be in
every relationship. We have always tried to make others
happy because we thought when they would be happy,
I will be happy too.
When we do something for others, let us first understand
that we chose to do it because they matter to us and we
are doing it for ourselves. Only then will we be happy
Taking our mind off from problems by watching
television, going shopping and other distractions is only
a temporary deviation from the pain; it is not happiness
because the healing has not happened.
