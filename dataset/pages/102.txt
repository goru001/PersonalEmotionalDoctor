cold shoulder to the other person, talking angrily to the
other person, it is actually a cold shoulder to me, it's anger
towards me, because whatever I am creating is first getting
created in my mind. This means I am the first one who
experiences it. The cold shoulder that I give you might not
affect you at all, but since I created the thought, I am bound
to get affected. So when you are doing something for other
people, good or bad, just remember that it's less for them
and more for yourself.
SO: A healthy thought, a healthy body, a healthy life.
SS: Nurture my pure thoughts, loving thoughts, forgiving
thoughts. Somebody has done something wrong, but I just
forgive and forget. I am not forgiving him I am forgiving
myself. If I keep holding on to the resentment and the hatred,
it's not for the other person, its here and it's in me. I am going
to be creating it and I am going to be experiencing it. So, the
entire responsibility comes back to me.
SO: The other day I met a Brahma Kumar who told me
about the time when somebody cheated him of fifty thousand
rupees. It was a big amount for him. And you know what
his reaction was? He said, 'May God give him so much that
he does not repeat this act with anybody else; he must be in
need of money; may God give him ten times more so that
some other person is not cheated like I have been. After
about eight years, the man who cheated came back with
the money.
SS: Your acquaintance sent him good vibrations, good wishes, pure energy. The person came and returned him the money
