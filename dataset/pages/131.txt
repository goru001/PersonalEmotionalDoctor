SO: I remember when I was in business there were so many
letters I used to write in anger in the night, after I had
closed down my office. I used to keep the letters for the
next morning to post, but I never used to do it.
SS: The mind is moving at a very fast speed, so postpone
your reaction till the speed slows down. See the situation in a
different perspective and then you may respond in a different
way. This is what we were trying to do right now. And what we
are trying to do now is keep the mind at a slow speed always.
SO: Again you go back to awareness.
SS: Yes. If you are aware, the speed is slow. Imagine that you
have a child playing in the room. If you are not looking at
the child; the child will do whatever he wants. He is dropping
things and breaking things. Now just stand in the corner and
watch the child. Don't say or do anything, just watch the child.
He will become aware and will control his activities.
SO: I try to watch this child (or mind) inside so much but
he finds some place and escapes.
SS: That's the journey, and it's not going to happen in one day.
Have you been able to do it sometimes?
SO: Yes.
SS: That's the proof that we can do it.
SO: Somewhere my mind doesn't like this kind of an exercise.
SS: A child never likes to be disciplined because he is used to
running around wherever he wants, doing whatever he wants.
Suddenly I say I am going to take charge of you now; now
