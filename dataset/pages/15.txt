so fast that we feel even the words are automated, and we say
I didn't mean to say that. So, a step further will be to become
aware of what I am thinking, to choose our thoughts and
thereby choose our responses. It's a simple exercise we begin
every morning and can do it any time during the day - just
watch your thoughts.
Relax and reflect on these thoughts:
What am I thinking right now: it could be about work, about
family, about friends, about myself. Let me look at my thoughts
look at myself during the whole day: driving to work, reaching
my desk, interacting with people I am doing everything but
I am choosing what to do and I am choosing how to be while
I am doing it I have a choice how to feel while I am doing
everything I am doing outside.... Situations, targets, goals,
people - they are all external.... Let me look at myself how l
think, how I feel, and then how I respond... I's my choice
I am the creator of my response. Om Shanti!
MANTRAS FOR HAPPINESS UNLIMITED
Happiness is not dependent on physical objects.
.
: Objects, possessions, gadgets, etc, are designed to give
us comfort.
Physical comfort is different from emotional comfort.
Happiness is our internal creation and can be created
irrespective of external comforts
