SO: When we were children our parents would buy something
for us, saying 'we'll buy this for him and make the child
happy or would take us for a picnic to make us feel happy'
So that is the way we got conditioned.
SS: Absolutely. Now I have the best bungalow and the best car,
and I have all possessions I could have dreamed of at home;I
have every gadget that I wanted. Then why am I still looking
for happiness? Shouldn't the search have ended because the
objects are all there at home? Name it and I have it all. But
I seem to be still searching for that feeling, which means the
gadgets are not able to give it to me. What I have got from
the gadgets is a comfortable life.
SO: In the context of the car that you mentioned, the
comfort is also no more there when the phone call says that
something unpleasant has happened at home. So, where is
the comfort here?
SS: Picture yourself sitting in the car, your back straight, and
your legs positioned comfortably. It is the mind that has suddenly
created the pain because of the new information. When the
mind gets uncomfortable, it is mind over matter. When the
mind is in pain, physical comfort is immaterial. The body is
comfortable but 'I' am uncomfortable at that moment.
I am looking for happiness. So, at that moment the physical
comfort does not matter. It could be the other way round too. I may be uncomfortable physically, I may just be sitting
cross-legged on the floor, but internally I feel bliss, and so I
am very comfortable
