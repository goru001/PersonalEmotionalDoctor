days down the line if the car gets a little scratch or a little
bump, my happiness is again going to get affected because I
have conditioned myself into believing that it is the car which
is giving me happiness. Now that is not true. You buy a new
car - the car could be of X amount, or it could be ten times
the X amount; in fact, it could be the most expensive car in
the world. You sit in the car and it very comfortable. So who
is experiencing the comfort? It's the body. It's got excellent
seats, a great music system and a very powerful AC. There
is complete physical comfort. I am comfortablesitting in the
car and so I tell myself that I am feeling good. And just at
that time I get a phone call saying something unpleasant has
happened at home. Will I still be happy?
SO: No.
SS: But I am still comfortable. The car is still there and I
am still in the car. The car was designed to give me physical
comfort and it will give me physical comfort irrespective of
any other life event that I encounter
SO: So, you mean to say that happiness and comfort are
two different things?
SS: Anything that is physical is designed to give me physiceal
comfort. The chair I am sitting on is physical and giving me
physical comfort, but I tell myself that this gives me happiness
SO: Is this a wrong belief that we have?
SS: It's just that we were conditioned to think like this right
from childhood. We have grown up with it. But now we need
to question our belief system.
