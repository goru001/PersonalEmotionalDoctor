SO: Yesterday I got an email from my niece, saying, 'uncle,
you do so many good things for us. But you made me feel
very unhappy when you were rude to me. She recounted
two incidents and my first justification was 'it was because
I was tired' Honestly speaking, though, she is right. Yes, I
was rude
SS: Fine, you can apologise now. But that will only happen
because you have started looking at yourself. If we give
justifications for our rudeness, then there is a whole list of
justifications. We like to justify our inadequacies and hide
our weaknesses
SO: Here also I blame my mind. I say my mind plays games
with me, I am not doing anything.
SS: My mind, it's mine. It's my responsibility; I am the creator.
We speak about our mind as if it was something different from
us. We are not ready to take responsibility of our mind, saying
it is not in my control. It's like a parent who has given up on
their child. Someone comes and says 'your child is not behaving
properly,' and you reply sorry, my child is not in my control,
please take care of my child. But because my mind is not in
my control, I try to control your mind. If you say something
to me right now and I am not able to control my mind, then
I try to control you. I say, 'is this the way to speak, because
I am not able to tell my mind 'is this is the way to think. So
I focus on teaching you how to speak, because if you speak
nicely then my mind is comfortable.
Let's try one thing. Let's see - how we want to think and
feel and be in every relationship.
