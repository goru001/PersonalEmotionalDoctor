Now he can drop this artificial defense mechanism and be

SO: So all these things can be overcome by being aware
of your thoughts. By being aware, you also detach, don't

perspective. Like in the case of this couple, the wife could see
only her perspective, 'how can my husband hit me, he does
not love me, he does not respect me. What she is feeling is
right, but she can see only her perspective. When she detached
from her perspective, she was able to see her husband's pain
and his perspective; she became stable. Her hatred turned
into sympathy.
We all talk about understanding people. We say we cannot
understand the other person, which means we just cannot see
their perspective because we are so attached to ours.
Earlier we could see the situation only from our side, and
from our side it was totally different. For me to be able to
see from your side I have to get up from this chair and then
come and sit on that chair. For that I have to detach myself
from this chair; I am so stuck to my position, to my ideas
of right that I can't even get up from here. When I get up
to be on your side, that's empathy and understanding, and
that's a relationship.
SO: You were mentioning the other day that when a
