SO: What is the care one should take?
SS: Discipline the mind, be aware, take care, and choose the
right thought.
SO: Somewhere it is very important to understand who I
am, how powerful I am. If I am peace, I don't say 'want'
anymore.
SS: Yes, I dont have to do anything to be peaceful.
SO: Then I don't say 'please give me some power?' I am
power, I am knowledge. If I am so much, and there is such
abundance, why will I need anything?
SS: We will not, at least not anything external. Everything
external is needed for physical comfort; it's needed for fun, for
excitement, for entertainment, but not for peace and happiness.
SO: So if I am going for a holiday. What should be my
thoughts? Earlier I used to get disappointed that I took
my family for a holiday to make them happy, but my child
came back unhappy.
SS: Be happy and then go for the holiday. Not go for the
holiday to be happy.
Because I am not going on the holiday for happiness; I am
going just for fun, for a change from the daily routine. That's
all that a holiday is. So the holiday will not be for pursuing
happiness; it will be for expressing and sharing the happiness
that we are filled with. The perspective changes from taking
to giving, so then we look forward to meeting people, we look
lorward to being with everybody, so that we can radiate our
happiness to them, not so that they can make us happy.
