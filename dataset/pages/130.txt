again, by asking you to do a benevolent act that will control the 
mind, which is running haywire, we are putting the stress on
'doing something outside which will help you to be peaceful'.
SO: But either way it works, doesn't it? Suppose I am in a
bad mood and I start dancing; it changes my mood. Your
mind is at least not as agitated as before, so you can take a
better decision. What I mean to say is even the outside - in
approach works to a certain extent?
SS: Outside - in works to an extent and for some time. Like
people say when angry count to ten. When we are angry, we
don't even realize before we react. If we had that awareness
that now I am angry, I need to stop and drink water and count
numbers, we would be aware enough not to react.
SO: So we come back to just being aware.
SS: Yes. These are only little-little things given to us so that we
can pause, take a break, and work on our mind. Like you said,
if I dance for some time at least my mind will be in a better
position to understand. So you have just given your mind a
little gap; I am upset with something but instead of confronting
you right now, I take a little gap. Now what is that little gap
for? So that I don't confront you right now. I postpone my
external reaction. The internal reaction is there; I resolve
issue internally and then I decide how to respond. There is a
difference between the reaction and the response. Reaction:
automated and not in my control; response: think, understand
and then respond. That's why we try and bring in those time
gaps, but sometimes, in fact quite often, the reaction is so fast 
that the time gap is lost.
