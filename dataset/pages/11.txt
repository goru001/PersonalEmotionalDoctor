the thought, it would create the same thought in everyone.
If the object - whether a car, a piece of jewellery, or a lovely
garden - is what is creating the thought, then it should create
the same thought in every person. Look at this greenery. You
may think how lovely it is to be with nature, while another
person may just overlook it while walking and not even realize
its beauty.
These are different responses to the same stimulus. The
response is the choice of the creator and I am the creator.
SO: I am the creator and I am creating unhappiness or
happiness. Sister Shivani, many of my thoughts and questions
have been answered by this. But how does one do without
a stimulus?
SS: By understanding that I am creating the thought. We
were not aware that we are the creators. We tend to believe
that thoughts come to us because of something outside. Let's
suppose that you say something which according to me is
a little rude, and I get hurt. I do not even think that I am
creating that feeling of being hurt. I very conveniently say
You hurt me. I think it is all coming from outside. Then I say
that you need to talk nicely to me for me to feel better. You
better apologize because once you do that, I am going to feel
better. This is dependency
SO: Then he would say I never meant that.
SS: But you hurt me. We can just go on and on. I am hurt
because of you I am angry because of you I am upset
because of you I am jealous because of you I am happy
because of you.
