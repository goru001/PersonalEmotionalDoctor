thought; automatically the aura will change, vibrations will
change, situation will change.
SO: Basically the colours and stones are changing our aura?
Ss: Yes, these too work, but how much, to what extent and
for how much time? Someone tells you to wear a red colour
shirt and things will be better; how often can one wear a red
colour shirt? Why not just create powerful thoughts instead?
We always thought that the easiest method was to change
something outside so as to experience a change inside; its
actually about changing something inside to experience results
outside. The process is inside out, not outside in. The inside
is in my control and is a permanent change.
SO: When you do it from outside, you do not have complete
control. People who predict something are not entirely right.
It happens often that you will call them and say that you
said this to me but it didn't happen, he will probably say,
"Sir, I am also a human being and cannot always be correct".
SS: They were not predicting reality; they were predicting
a probability. We have to remember this. We have no right
to say anything to them. A probability will always have a
percentage. They may even predict that your next six months
will be very nice, but if you are demotivated inside, nothing is
going to be smooth. So the prediction is going to be wrong.
We have been discussing about the effect of external
influences on our mind. We are practicing to enable our mind
to go beyond the influence of situations, objects and people. If 
my mind can go beyond the influence of situations and people,
then we can also go beyond the influence of planets. Planets
