away for the next few hours, before I come back to what I
was thinking
SS: This is because I haven't done it in a very long time. Once
I do it regularly, I won't need to stop and look at what I am
thinking. I will always be aware of what I am thinking. Suppose
today has not been a nice day at work; so I come back and I
am sitting with the paper. The television is on but my mind
is working - it's not interested in the running television. I am
thinking - this shouldn't have happened, this is not the way
things should have happened today, this is not the way they
should have spoken to me. I have been working so hard, but
I just don't get recognised for my work. Who is thinking all
this? I am thinking. That's all; this is awareness; this is what
I am thinking. The second stage of awareness is: is this the
right kind of thinking for me? And third stage of awareness
is: can I change it? That's all.

SO: What will happen if I am not thinking? I have to think
something.
SS: Yes, there is never a stage when we are not thinking.
SO: Either some kind of song goes on, or some kind of a
jingle, or something said by somebody .. it goes on and on;
the mind is all the time on. And you mean to say one has to
switch it over to something else, to feed it something else
SS: It's like water, flowing constantly. I can't stop it but I can
always channelize it; I don't have to flow this side, I can flow
the other side. So I just change the direction of the water, give
it a new direction to flow. Similarly, I dont stop thinking. A
lot of people think meditation means to stop thinking,
and so
