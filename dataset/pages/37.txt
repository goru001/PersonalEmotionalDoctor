SO: So that he won't repeat the mistake again. I am doing
him a favour.
SS: You see I am more interested in teaching others rather
than taking care of myself. Whether it's a small situation or
a big one, I have a choice of how I am going to respond. Let
me just sit back and be aware in every situation. If I just say
it's okay and drive on, how do I feel on that day?
SO: I would feel nice about it.
SS: Because you have conserved energy and conquered your own
weakness. So it is something that has to be experimented with.
SO: The other day I was going to the airport and somebody
banged my car. My driver was just about to get out and fight,
but I asked him to keep quiet, close the door and ignore
the other person. I felt nice about it. Right now, conversing
with you, I realize I felt nice because I kind of conquered
my weakness that has been there for years and years.
SS: Also, you had the right thoughts at that moment, so you
felt better. If you create the thought that 'it's okay, it's just an
accident, move on now' it's a positive thought. It's a good
feeling. But if I have thoughts like - why didn't he look where
he was driving; he should have been driving carefully; who
gives them their driving license; they think they own the road
- how are you going to feel after that? The thoughts you have
will determine your feelings. Then, after all this we reach our
destination, maybe we were headed to our workplace.
