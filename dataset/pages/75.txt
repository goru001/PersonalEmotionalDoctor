going to use it. It depends on how we are going to sit back
and stop blaming others. We disempower ourselves by not
using our will power.
SO: I met someone who took two days to quit his habit
of drinking of 30 years. You mean to say I have the same
amount of will power as him? If yes, then what is it that
I am unable to see that I have will power or what is it
that's stopping me from using it?
SS: It's simple: I am not using it. A human quality is useful
only if it is being used.
SO: But what if I don't know whether I have a quality
or not? I don't know how to see or use the quality.
SS: That's why we are learning. It's that area of life on which
we now start focusing attention. If we say we don't have time
for spirituality; we don't have time to meditate; then we are
choosing not to use the powers that we have. We are choosing
not to apply the tools that are there.
It's like I have a whole lot of property in my locker but
I am refuse to open it and use it for myself and helping
others; rather, I go around begging people for love, peace and
happiness because I don't want to use the time to go into my
own locker, open it and use it from there.
SO: So your locker is meditation?
SS: It's here in the mind and the key is with us, and only we
know how to open it.
