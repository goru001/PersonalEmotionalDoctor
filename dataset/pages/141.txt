approval from people around us seems to be the foundation
of our self-esteem
SO: Sister Shivani why is it easier to misunderstand
than understand?
SS: We misunderstand because we are hurt. We are in pain,
and when in pain we will never see the situation in the right
perspective.
SO: What you say is right but it's easier to misunderstand
than understand.
SS: Your shirt is white in colour. But if I wear different colour
glasses, it will appear a different colour to me every time.
You are who you are, but if there is a different colour, or
perspective every time because of my pain, my hurt, my ego,
you will appear different to me. So it's a misunderstanding.
Clean your own windows. Don't ask them to change their
shirt.
SO: That's what you meant by morning meditation and
before-sleep meditation. That is also part of cleansing.
SS: Absolutely. Any blockage, any negative thought, and I will
look at everyone through that window. If I have been hurt
because of something that happened with you and I am in
pain, I carry that pain with me to everyone, and I will see
everyone through that pain. If I have been rejected by you
and my self-esteem is low, my self-esteem will be low with
everyone. It's not that my self-esteem is low when I am with
you and high when I am with someone else.
