a moment that is still to come. Both are not in my control.
The past and the future are not in my control.
S0: Past, future, or thinking about other people, they are
a waste.
SS: Even when I am thinking about other people - they should
have done this, why did they do this, I want them to do this - 
it's either in the past or in the future. I don't accept them
in the present moment as they are. If we just practise this for
one day, if we are just aware about this for one day, we will
be shocked. At any moment just check what you are thinking.
You will be thinking either about something that has
already happened or about something that is still to happen.
So we are living either in the past or in the future. Both are
a waste because both are not in my control.
SO: I remember once I was driving home from my shooting
and was thinking of my scene that I had just rehearsed. I
was driving alone and thinking. I wish I had done that. As
the scene kept playing in my mind, I crossed my home. I
had to take a U-turn and go back.
SS: Actually we can cross our whole life if we are like this,
thinking about the past or the future. Just be constantly aware
that first is knowledge that I am the creator of the thought
and second that there are these different types of thoughts.
negative and waste thoughts are damaging. Waste thoughts
are a waste of energy and this waste, in turn, is followed by
further negative thoughts. The minute I go into the past, the
thoughts run along these lines: Oh! It should have been like this; 
it should not have been like that; Those days were better
