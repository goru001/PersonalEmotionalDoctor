SS: So they are already creating anger. It's a silent anger, its
internal. Anger is anger, whether it is in the form of hurt, in
the form of hatred, or in the form of verbal abuse. It's having
an effect on you. But once I start taking care of my thoughts
and feelings, I will be able to stop outside first and gradually
will stop creating it inside. Then it will not matter whether its
my boss or my child; the rule remains the same.
SO: So, to experience unlimited happiness what should one
do? How does one acquire this kind of mental stability?
SS: First, understand that anger is not strength; it's absolute
weakness because in those moments I have gone out of control,
and going out of control is not strength.
SO: If anger is not strength, what is anger? Is it a void? Is
it frustration or an inferiority complex?
SS: Anger is the whole turbulence that takes place inside; I
justify it and I blame the world for what I am feeling, and I
want to get back at them. The anger could be because of one
person and it might come out on another one. We give vent
to our anger in various ways and towards various people. You
say I can't say anything to the boss; so when I come home I
shout at my wife. My wife can't say anything to me, so she
goes and shouts at the child. So I can't say that I didn't get
angry at all; it's just that I accumulated it inside at the moment
when things were heated. I didn't vent it but then I created
it, and eventually took it out on someone or the other. Let's
understand this mechanism. Probably then, I will be paying
a little more attention to what I am doing in my life. Every
time I create a thought, what's the next thing that happens?
