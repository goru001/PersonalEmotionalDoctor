you but what was the energy that I was creating while I was
doing it? Relationships are not actions; relationships are the
energies that we exchange while doing those actions. So if it's

SS: That's because our focus is all on the doing. Look at the
priorities through the day; I have to DO this, I have to DO
that. The focus has rarely been I have to BE like this.
SO: Let's say for homework, children say I have to do so

SS: Yes, they have to do it, but care has to be on how they are
feeling while doing it. They need to be calm, peaceful, happy,
and then do it. Lets say I have to run from here to there; I
have to be healthy to do it. If I am not healthy and I try to
run, the journey will be tiresome, painful and a struggle. Now
