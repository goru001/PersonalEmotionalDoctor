SO: After the thought will be the action.
SS: That's a later stage. What happens just after I create the
thought?
SO: When I create a thought, I am creating certain emotions
within me.
SS: Yes. Immediately after I create a thought, the next
thing that happens is the feeling. Sometimes we are not
aware of our thoughts but we are aware of our feelings. I
am not feeling very nice today; I am not sure which is the
thought that I created but I am aware that I am not feeling
nice today. Or I am feeling very nice today; whatever I am
feeling, it's because of some thoughts that I created. So, if I
am not aware of my thoughts, let me just be aware of how
I am feeling today because the feeling is only a result of the
thought. I have to meet you.. this is a thought that I will
create. Based on my past experiences or what I have heard
about you, it will immediately generate a feeling. Thought is
always followed by a feeling.
All my feelings put together about you, about the world,
help me develop my attitude. A thought about you is followed
by a feeling subsequently; and because this has happened many
times, an attitude towards you is also created. You know, when
we talk about 'changing our attitude', it is about changing the
thought. How can I change my atitude? I have to first change
the thoughts that I created.
We cannot change our attitude. We have to change the
thoughts, and our attitude will automatically change.
