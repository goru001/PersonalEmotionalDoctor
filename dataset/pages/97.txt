I should speak like this. Here I am the boss, so this is the way
to behave with my juniors. The actor inside is just not aware.
SO: But Sister Shivani, everybody behaves differently at
different places and times. One is different in office, at home,
with wife, with friends, and so on.
SS: Which one of these is our original nature?
SO: I don't know which one is original. I am confused. There
are so many different roles.
SS: Let's take a simple example. We walk into an office and
within 10 minutes we meet four people: one from the security,
one at the reception, then someone in middle management, and
finally the top chairman. Four people in 10 minutes, and four
times our behaviour changes. My way of talking to the security
guard and my way of talking to the chairman are different.
Out of these four which one is my original personality?
SO: I am confused. I am playing different roles all the time.
I don't have a consistent role.
SS: My original personality is not there because I am changing
every time. I talked to a security guard, I talked to a receptionist,
and accordingly I changed. Next I talked to a manager and so I changed; then I talked to a chairman, and again I changed.
I'm connecting to positions, to status, to physical looks, to all
the things that are acquired
SO: But if I ask this question to anybody, they will say what
is wrong in doing that. So isn't it normal, since everybody
does it?
