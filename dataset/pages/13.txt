a normal reaction too. Becoming tense is normal, to worry
is normal, to fear is normal, to feel sad is normal, but
feel happy doesn't come so easily to us. Problems will come,
challenges will be there, but to despair or to deal with them
is our choice.
Because everything else is outside.
SO: But that outside is also disturbing me inside.
SS: That's the choice. Does it disturb everyone in the same
manner? Faced with failure, someone could go into depression,
someone else could commit suicide, and yet another one would
say 'Okay, I'm doing it again' and be successful the next time.
This is same failure, but different responses.
That's why my thoughts and feelings are in my hand. Just
this one mechanism will change the way I live my life.
SO: But isn't it too quick? Between the moment when
something happens and when you react, there is hardly any
time to tell oneself that Look, this is a thought and it is
just something outside and not inside. Where is the time
for me to control my reaction?
SS: That's why we are living our lives in an automated mode. You
know it's like how a machine functions. What's the difference
between a machine and a human being?
A machine has no choice - we put it on and off and then
on and off. It is dependent on the person who is using it. You
press the button and it's on, press the button again and it's
off. Human beings, have a choice. Someone comes and says
something to me - they press a button; if I am a machine
will say 'obviously I will get angry. What is obvious about it?
