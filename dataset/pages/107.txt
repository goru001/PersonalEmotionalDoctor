thoughts and feelings for the opposite person who has just
shouted at me?
SO: The second option is very, very difficult.
SS: So that's where strength comes in.
SO: And you think doing something difficult is strength.
SS: Yes, because it requires strength to do something difficult.
I have to pick up this whole chair, it requires strength. I say
I can't do it; it's my physical weakness. To do something
against the tide, of negative energy, to remain protected first
and then create positive energy against the tide of negative
energy requires a tremendous amount of strength. To shout
back and say he shouted at me first, what kind of strength
does that require?
SO: In school we used to get bullied. If we kept quiet, we
would be called a sissy. You are not a man, people would say.
SS: When we are bullied, we are quiet but internally we are
disturbed. If the boss shouts at me, I can't say anything back
because of his position. But internally I am not stable; it starts
having an impact on me. People will say that I may as well
shout back and finish it off, it's better to get angry rather than
keep my anger inside. Here we are not talking about keeping
our anger inside; we are simply not creating that turbulent
energy; that is strength.
SO: Sister Shivani, it's so difficult these days to say a word
to your boss. Everyone wants to retain their position. People
hear so much from bosses, but internally they are in pain.
