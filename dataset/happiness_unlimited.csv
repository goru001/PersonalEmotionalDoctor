" What is the meaning of happiness?
 ",SO,1
" Happiness is the one thing in life that everyone is
 looking for, irrespective of what we are doing, what relationships
 we have established, what we are trying to achieve, and so on.
 If we think about life, clearly all of us are looking for happiness.
 ",SS,1
" We are looking for happiness as you said. But what is
 it through which we are looking for it?
 ",SO,1
" We do it through different means - it could be through
 possessions, through property, through relationships, through
 achievements, through good health. Like, if you ask someone
 what they want in life, they often say 'success'. Why they want
 success is primarily because it makes them happy. You ask
 someone why they want to buy a particular thing. The most
 likely response is that it makes them happy or maybe it makes
 the family happy. Again you ask someone what they get out
 of a relationship? Yet again, the response is often Happiness.
 So, finally everyone is looking for that one word - happiness.
 ",SS,1
" But is happiness limited or unlimited? It is limited,
 isn't it?
 ",SO,1
" It is. In fact, I don't even know whether it's there
 ",SS,1
" So it is momentary - like a child who plays with a
 toy and breaks it, and then wants to try another one, then
 another one, and so on. So what are we looking for actually?
 If we are looking for happiness, shouldn't it be something
 concrete and permanent?
 ",SO,1
" It should be permanent, that's most important. If happiness
 is something that I like, if it's something that I desire, and if
 comes naturally to me, then it won't be dependent on anything
 else outside. If it's dependent on something, then it can never
 be constant.
 Simply put, if you are looking for it outside somewhere
 then you are dependent on that thing and the feeling won't
 sustain. Lets say I feel good if the weather is pleasant; my
 feeling good is then dependent on the weather
 ",SS,1
" Sure! But what I want to understand is that how can
 one have happiness without desires and dependency?
 ",SO,1
" That's probably one of the oldest belief systems we have
 allowed ourselves to live by - the belief that happiness is to
 be got from the outside, whether it's from achievements or
 from people or from what we are. I am doing this so that I
 will feel happy' is always the equation. When it's done, and
 done in the right way, I will feel happy. So, the dependency
 is on the act being performed in the right manner. Right
 from when a child is conditioned by the parents to make the
 parents feel good when the child gets good marks, when the
 child performs well, when the child looks good.
 Slowly a child is conditioned to believe that if my parents
 feel happy then I will feel happy, and if my parents are not
 happy then how can I be happy?
 ",SS,1
" Can you share some easier way or the right way whereby
 we can understand the meaning of happiness and understand
 how to achieve it without dependency?
 ",SO,1
" First and foremost, let's try and see on what it is dependent.
 The simplest dependency that we experience on a daily basis is
 on objects. I'll feel happy when I buy a new car; I'll feel happy
 when I buy new property; I am happy when I go shopping.
 ",SS,1
" But what is wrong in this? Isn't this natural?
 ",SO,1
" What is more important - Is it true?' Are these dependencies
 actually making us happy?
 ",SS,1
" Honestly speaking, I will feel happy if I bought a new car.
 ",SO,1
" Of course you will, but is it the car which is giving you
 that happiness, which you are looking for?
 I will feel happy when I have a new car . which means
 if I don't, then it's a question mark. This also means that 10
 days down the line if the car gets a little scratch or a little
 bump, my happiness is again going to get affected because I
 have conditioned myself into believing that it is the car which
 is giving me happiness. Now that is not true. You buy a new
 car - the car could be of X amount, or it could be ten times
 the X amount; in fact, it could be the most expensive car in
 the world. You sit in the car and it very comfortable. So who
 is experiencing the comfort? It's the body. It's got excellent
 seats, a great music system and a very powerful AC. There
 is complete physical comfort. I am comfortablesitting in the
 car and so I tell myself that I am feeling good. And just at
 that time I get a phone call saying something unpleasant has
 happened at home. Will I still be happy?
 ",SS,1
" No.
 ",SO,1
" But I am still comfortable. The car is still there and I
 am still in the car. The car was designed to give me physical
 comfort and it will give me physical comfort irrespective of
 any other life event that I encounter
 ",SS,1
" So, you mean to say that happiness and comfort are
 two different things?
 ",SO,1
" Anything that is physical is designed to give me physiceal
 comfort. The chair I am sitting on is physical and giving me
 physical comfort, but I tell myself that this gives me happiness
 ",SS,1
" Is this a wrong belief that we have?
 ",SO,1
" It's just that we were conditioned to think like this right
 from childhood. We have grown up with it. But now we need
 to question our belief system.
 ",SS,1
" When we were children our parents would buy something
 for us, saying 'we'll buy this for him and make the child
 happy or would take us for a picnic to make us feel happy'
 So that is the way we got conditioned.
 ",SO,1
" Absolutely. Now I have the best bungalow and the best car,
 and I have all possessions I could have dreamed of at home;I
 have every gadget that I wanted. Then why am I still looking
 for happiness? Shouldn't the search have ended because the
 objects are all there at home? Name it and I have it all. But
 I seem to be still searching for that feeling, which means the
 gadgets are not able to give it to me. What I have got from
 the gadgets is a comfortable life.
 ",SS,1
" In the context of the car that you mentioned, the
 comfort is also no more there when the phone call says that
 something unpleasant has happened at home. So, where is
 the comfort here?
 ",SO,1
" Picture yourself sitting in the car, your back straight, and
 your legs positioned comfortably. It is the mind that has suddenly
 created the pain because of the new information. When the
 mind gets uncomfortable, it is mind over matter. When the
 mind is in pain, physical comfort is immaterial. The body is
 comfortable but 'I' am uncomfortable at that moment.
 I am looking for happiness. So, at that moment the physical
 comfort does not matter. It could be the other way round too. I may be uncomfortable physically, I may just be sitting
 cross-legged on the floor, but internally I feel bliss, and so I
 am very comfortable
 ",SS,1
" How does one get there?
 ",SO,1
" One gets there by understanding that physical comfort is
 separate from emotional comfort. I was not able to experience
 internal comfort - the internal stability that we call happiness,
 but I thought that if I am physically comfortable, then that
 means I will be happy. Today, we have started to buy happiness
 If I buy this, this and this the list is never-ending I will be
 happy. This doesn't mean that we don't buy those things, rather
 let's not associate them with our being happy. I generally buy
 a thing because it's useful, it's comfortable or it's productive
 But is it happiness? No!
 At least I know why I am buying something; and I don't
 tell my mind that when I buy this I will be happy. If I associate
 material things with happiness then I am postponing my
 happiness and putting a new condition to it. Let's suppose
 that I am building a new house and I tell myself that when
 this house is built and I shift there, then I will be happy. This
 could mean after a year or after two years.
 So, again I am postponing my happiness until a future time.
 Think of a child - we look at the child in school and say that
 childhood is the best phase of life, but the child looks at the
 grownups around him and thinks they are so lucky, for they
 don't have to do homework or give an exam. He wishes to be
 in their place. The child is looking to be out of school so that
 he can be happy. He feels he will be very happy when he goes
 to a college. Then, when he gets into a college the thought is
 redefined. He feels he will be very happy when he gets a job
 is married and has a family. But soon, he feels that he will
 be very happy when his children are settled. Few years down
 the line, the children are settled and everything is fine. What
 is the thought now? He feels he will be very happy when he
 retires. So, when will he actually be happy? He postponed his
 happiness to a different stage of life and every time there was
 a new blank toill in. We are stuck in a vicious circle where
 we tell ourselves: when this happens, I will be happy.
 ",SS,1
" How distressing!
 ",SO,1
" True! And that's why we are not happy.
 ",SS,1
" We see so many people who are rich; they have helicopters,
 private airplanes, their own boats, everything. They still
 wander from temple to temple, from one guru to another.
 Finally, what are they seeking? How does one put an end
 to this search?
 ",SO,1
" First, by understanding that it is separate and second, by
 understanding that it is my internal creation and I can create
 it irrespective of everything else. I buy a car and then I say
 I am happy. The car is a physical object with no feelings or
 emotions. Obviously the car is not giving me happiness. So,
 what is? I create the thought: 'Wow! I bought a car. I finally
 bought what I wanted: These are positive thoughts.
 It is the same with say a woman with a new jewellery set.
 Is it the jewellery set that is giving her happiness? Or it is she
 who is creating the positive thought of possessing that set,
 which she thinks is giving her happiness?
 ",SS,1
" But don't you think that the positive thought cannot
 be created minus the jewellery set?
 ",SO,1
" Yeah! This means I need an object as a stimulus to create
 a response. So it's the object, and the object can be anything,
 like the jewellery set. I look at the object and I create a thou
 within.
 So when we acquire the object, our natural response is
 This is a lovely piece of jewellery that I have just got: Now
 who created this thought?
 ",SS,1
" That's a tricky question to answer. I create the thought
 or was it created because of the object.
 ",SO,1
" A physical piece of jewellery does not have thoughts and
 feelings. I look at it and I create a thought 'I have bought
 such a lovely piece of jewellery!' If 10 minutes later somebody
 walks into the room and says this is not looking nice on you or
 says this is fake, then what? Now who is creating the response?
 If the stimulus was creating the response then the stimulus will
 keep on creating the same response, irrespective of a change
 in situation. Further, if I show the same piece of jewellery
 to 10 people, will all of them create the same thoughts? For
 someone it's too loud I can't wear this, I don't like this at
 all; for another it could be I am sorry, I don't like jewellery
 at all, it could also be I really want this or how sad that I
 can't afford this. The piece of jewellery is the same.
 ",SS,1
" My reaction to the piece is my choice.
 ",SO,1
" It is my thought.
 ",SS,1
" I am reacting, which means I am creating. I am creating
 either happiness or unhappiness.
 ",SO,1
" So we could create thoughts of pleasure or thoughts of
 jealousy or hurt with the same object of jewellery. The stimulus
 is the same, the object is the same. If the object had to crea
 te
 the thought, it would create the same thought in everyone.
 If the object - whether a car, a piece of jewellery, or a lovely
 garden - is what is creating the thought, then it should create
 the same thought in every person. Look at this greenery. You
 may think how lovely it is to be with nature, while another
 person may just overlook it while walking and not even realize
 its beauty.
 These are different responses to the same stimulus. The
 response is the choice of the creator and I am the creator.
 ",SS,1
" I am the creator and I am creating unhappiness or
 happiness. Many of my thoughts and questions
 have been answered by this. But how does one do without
 a stimulus?
 ",SO,1
" By understanding that I am creating the thought. We
 were not aware that we are the creators. We tend to believe
 that thoughts come to us because of something outside. Let's
 suppose that you say something which according to me is
 a little rude, and I get hurt. I do not even think that I am
 creating that feeling of being hurt. I very conveniently say
 You hurt me. I think it is all coming from outside. Then I say
 that you need to talk nicely to me for me to feel better. You
 better apologize because once you do that, I am going to feel
 better. This is dependency
 ",SS,1
" Then he would say I never meant that.
 ",SO,1
" But you hurt me. We can just go on and on. I am hurt
 because of you I am angry because of you I am upset
 because of you I am jealous because of you I am happy
 because of you.
 ",SS,1
" If everything is happening because of others around, it
 means I am not taking responsibility of mysell.
 ",SO,1
" No responsibility and no control. How helpless are we if
 we are always dependent on anything external
 ",SS,1
" Isn't that a weakness?
 ",SO,1
" But isn't that the way we are living our lives? The minute
 we understand that this is an illusion, that they are not
 controlling us, and we are not dependent on them, we have
 a choice of what we create. This is independence. That's why
 the first thing that spirituality gives us is freedom. It liberates
 us. We are liberated from all the dependencies, everything we
 thought we were dependent on and postponed your happiness.
 We just postponed it, convincing ourselves that we could not
 be happy till we had what we wanted.
 ",SS,1
" It is very difficult to understand how I can be happy
 without what I want?
 ",SO,1
" We talked about objects, but what about achievements? 'I wanted to achieve this particular goal but I haven't reached
 there, so how can I be happy?' We have been brought up
 to believe that only those who achieve what they want
 will be happy This is what we were taught when we were
 children.
 ",SS,1
" I always thought that it was very natural to be that
 way. If I fail to get a job three times in a row, then I feel
 depressed, and it's very normal. I used to think like that.
 ",SO,1
" I thought that my happiness was dependent on getting the
 job. I thought it was normal and that's why getting upset was
 a normal reaction too. Becoming tense is normal, to worry
 is normal, to fear is normal, to feel sad is normal, but
 feel happy doesn't come so easily to us. Problems will come,
 challenges will be there, but to despair or to deal with them
 is our choice.
 Because everything else is outside.
 ",SS,1
" But that outside is also disturbing me inside.
 ",SO,1
" That's the choice. Does it disturb everyone in the same
 manner? Faced with failure, someone could go into depression,
 someone else could commit suicide, and yet another one would
 say 'Okay, I'm doing it again' and be successful the next time.
 This is same failure, but different responses.
 That's why my thoughts and feelings are in my hand. Just
 this one mechanism will change the way I live my life.
 ",SS,1
" But isn't it too quick? Between the moment when
 something happens and when you react, there is hardly any
 time to tell oneself that Look, this is a thought and it is
 just something outside and not inside. Where is the time
 for me to control my reaction?
 ",SO,1
" That's why we are living our lives in an automated mode. You
 know it's like how a machine functions. What's the difference
 between a machine and a human being?
 A machine has no choice - we put it on and off and then
 on and off. It is dependent on the person who is using it. You
 press the button and it's on, press the button again and it's
 off. Human beings, have a choice. Someone comes and says
 something to me - they press a button; if I am a machine
 will say 'obviously I will get angry. What is obvious about it?
 Obvious is only for a machine because it is made to work
 automatically.
 
 ",SS,1
" But everybody is living in that automated mode except
 for the saints and a few others.
 ",SO,1
" No, it's not about saints. It's just about being aware that
 we are human beings. People are pressing the button but we
 have a choice.
 ",SS,1
" Do say something about the meditation you do every
 day: Probably because of this practice you have been able
 to understand the difference between what is happening
 outside and what you are creating inside. How can one
 meditate like you? People usually think that meditation is
 about sitting in a corner and not thinking. It's so difficult
 for us to not think for a moment. Can you make this a
 little easy for us?
 ",SO,1
" Let me tell you a very simple thing: meditation is not
 about stopping the thinking process, rather it is to be aware
 of what I am thinking and to choose what I am going to be
 thinking.
 ",SS,1
" To be aware of what I am thinking
 ",SO,1
" Yes, like we are aware of what we are speaking.
 ",SS,1
" I am not aware.
 ",SO,1
" You are not speaking in an automated mode. You choose
 what to speak, you choose your actions - when to sit, when
 to get up, when to walk, when to sleep. We are choosing our
 actions, our words. Of course, sometimes the thoughts come
 so fast that we feel even the words are automated, and we say
 I didn't mean to say that. So, a step further will be to become
 aware of what I am thinking, to choose our thoughts and
 thereby choose our responses. It's a simple exercise we begin
 every morning and can do it any time during the day - just
 watch your thoughts",SS,1
" You say it is 'I' who create happiness, I
 who create sadness. It's finally I who is responsible. Yet
 it's very difficult to be happy when you have not achieved
 something in life.
 ",SO,2
" There are two dynamics here: one, if I achieve this then
 I will be happy, and another, I will be happy while achieving
 this. Its like we are on a journey, say from X to Y, and Y is
 the destination whether we are going by road, by train, or
 by air. When we start on the journey, others wish us a safe
 journey, not 'reach your destination anyways. It's not only
 reaching the destination that matters, it's the quality of the
 journey that counts.
 ",SS,2
" That's how many of us think that we have to reach our
 destination by hook or by crook.
 ",SO,2
" Okay, let's look at it this way. I have set a goal for myself,
 whether it's for marks as a student, for a professional position
 in my organization, or it could be in my relationships. In an
 case, we are not going to be able to lead our lives without
 goals, because without goals we will become passive. I wouldn't
 know where I am heading. Now, the other thing that I do is
 tell myself that I will be happy when I reach the goal.
 goal may take six months or six years. So I start moving to
 say, reach this particular position in my organization in the
 coming two years. Now I start my journey. It is about the
 way I work, the way I am with my colleagues, the way I am
 performing. Continuously, at the back of my mind I believe
 that when I reach there I will be happy. Now if there is a
 little lapse in the way I am working, if people around me are
 uncooperative, if there are certain obstacles coming in the
 way, what will happen to me?
 ",SS,2
" I will not be happy.
 ",SO,2
" Because I will create stress, I will create anxiety. Why?
 Because people are coming in the way of my happiness. I see
 them as obstacles not just in my goal, but also in my happiness
 Now suppose that I am going to walk from here to there and
 my mind says happiness is there. I start walking. While I am
 walking you are in the way, and because you are in the way
 I see you as someone in the way of my happiness. I will do
 anything to get you out of the way. If you are just a junior
 I will shout at you and order you to work fast. If you are a
 colleague and I think you are a threat to me in my reaching
 the goal, I can plot anything against you to get you out of the
 way. I may even compromise on my values. Suppose during
 my journey you tell me that if I am honest I'll have to stop
 here for one week, but if I tell a lie I can go there faster. Now,
 many of us wouldn't even think twice before using the other
 method. I might end up telling a lie and that's where I will
 compromise on my values and principles during my journey.I
 have begun to think that my values and principles are delaying
 my process of attaining my happiness.
 ",SS,2
" But if you are going to get happiness, how does it matter
 if you were to lie?
 ",SO,2
" At this moment we are still on the journey; we haven't
 reached the destination yet. While on the journey, I am creating
 anger and stress, and I am compromising on my values and
 principles. So, I am creating negative emotions in the course of
 my journey. For six months I create anxiety and stress, which
 in turn can disturb my relationships and create issues with
 people at work. My inner state of mind will be in an upheaval,
 and eventually it will start affecting my physical health. Finally
 after six months when I reach my goal, how will I feel?
 ",SS,2
" Don't you think you will be happy?
 ",SO,2
" If I have created all these negative emotions on the way I
 have experienced and have also transmitted the same emotions
 to everyone around me; all this happened on the journey. It's
 like I have fallen down, hurt myself, and then reached there
 By the time I reached there, I am totally in pain. But because
 I have reached there I am very happy. Now my conditioning
 says happiness is dependent on achievement
 ",SS,2
" You want to achieve further. The driving force becomes
 achieve-achieve-achieve,' and you are caught up in its pursuit,
 You go home and say oh, I'm so sorry I have been behaving
 like this, coming home late at night, troubling you, but I
 have to achieve the target?
 ",SO,2
" So, if for example you set a six-month goal, for the whole
 of six months you are allowing yourself to get bruised and
 hurt emotionally
 ",SS,2
" This means we are not just postponing happiness, we
 are actually creating unhappiness all the way. And this is
 going to multiply.
 ",SO,2
" Exactly. In the first six months, to reach (A) I was bruised
 because I created negative emotions around me, hurt people, lost
 my temper, whatever. By the time I reach (A), my emotional
 strength has already become weaker. During the next journey
 from (A) to (B), my strength is already weakened. It is the
 same environment, the same people, the same situations, but
 the weak emotional strength means I am going to get bruised
 further.
 ",SS,2
" Is it emotional strength?
 ",SO,2
" My power to face situations. I will get hurt more easily,I
 will react, I will get irritated.
 ",SS,2
" Don't you think all these things also make you physically
 weak?
 ",SO,2
" It's going to have an effect on the body, but when we are
 young we don't feel the impact. So we think it is absolutely
 fine, this is natural, this is the way to live. It's only later that we
 start showing symptoms of hypertension, diabetes and similar
 troubles. Since we accept stress as a part of our lives we also
 accept the physical symptoms as inevitable.
 ",SS,2
" I still can't understand how someone can be happy
 without achieving his goal. He comes home as a failure, and
 with so many problems
 ",SO,2
" Let's say I am looking for a job and I have been trying
 for the last six months. I am not getting a job and I am very
 demotivated and upset. As a friend, what would you say to me?
 ",SS,2
" Don't worry, it happens. One day you will get it.
 Meanwhile please let me know if I can be of help.
 ",SO,2
" If I say how can I not be worried, I haven't got a job for
 the last six months, what are you going to say to me?
 ",SS,2
" By worrying will you get it?
 ",SO,2
" So just lets say this to ourselves: by worrying will l get it
 ",SS,2
" That is very easily said
 ",SO,2
" But that's the solution. The more I worry, the weaker my
 mind becomes; it starts to show in my body language; I lose
 my enthusiasm and I get thoughts like how will I get a job? To
 get a job I need confidence, I need to be enthusiastic, I need
 to be ready to face the challenges the new job offers. It's not
 about what has happened, it's about what I need to do now
 how does my state of being have to be. I have to take care
 of that, else I am trapped in the vicious cycle of negativity.
 Who is going to employ a person who is demotivated and has
 given up on life? Who do you think will hire a person who
 has lost his internal strength and tolerance, who is unable to
 get along with people, and is not able to create team spirit?
 Who is going to hire a candidate like that? So, whatever the
 situation may be and however challenging it may be, I am
 not going to get the solution unless I take care of myself
 My business is not doing well and so it is natural for me to
 worry, but if I worry I will still not be able to do well. If I
 want to do well outside, I will have to be well within. But
 what is most important is: even if I don't do well, at least I
 can take care of myself.
 ",SS,2
" I had a guru who told me about a man who was
 undergoing a prolonged struggle due to a court case. At the
 same time he was also worried about his wife, who was very
 sick. Finally, after about 15 years he won the court case and
 his wife too recovered. But then he himself fell sick and died.
 Despite knowing of this humbling tale, why is it so difficult
 for me to understand what you are telling me right now?
 ",SO,2
" It's about priorities in life. What are my responsibilities in
 life? Normally I will count my family, my job, my work, my
 home, my friends, my relatives, my society, my relationships,
 my country..
 We can take responsibility of our family and move on to
 the entire world, but not our own responsibility. Let's say we
 are a family of five and four of them are not well. I want to
 take the responsibility of taking care of them, of healing them,
 but I will only be able to do that if I am healthy myself. This
 is about physical health. Now you apply the same equation
 to emotional health; I want to take care of my children, my
 wife, my husband, my parents; I want to ensure that they are
 happy.. but I am in pain.
 ",SS,2
" I even get sad when they are not able to do well in class.
 I wanted them to become swimming champions, tennis
 players, and so on.
 ",SO,2
" Why do you want to do all that? just so that they will be
 happy! Finally, I want everyone around me to be happy.
 ",SS,2
" And if they are happy, I will be happy.
 ",SO,2
" I thought I would take care of everything and then they
 will be happy; and when they are happy, then I will be happy.
 Spirituality teaches us that when I am happy and I am able to
 take care of them, then they will also be happy.
 ",SS,2
" So when I am happy, I am also spreading my happy
 emotions around. Wherever I go I am alive with happiness
 and I make other people happy too.
 ",SO,2
" Because you make them stronger. Let's see, what is happiness?
 Happiness is an internal strength. It does not mean excitement,
 I am not going to be jumping and dancing the whole day. I
 have lost my job and I am not excited about it.
 ",SS,2
" Happiness is strength I am not able to understand this.
 ",SO,2
" See, at any given point in time, there can only be one
 thought in the mind. One thought possesses one quality. That
 one quality could be either the right quality or the not-so-right
 quality. If I am creating a pure, powerful and positive thought,
 then it is the right quality. If I am creating a negative thought,
 an unpleasant thought, a thought of anxiety, pain and worry
 its a wrong thought. If it's the right thought I feel good; if it's
 not the right thought I feel low. If it's the right thought, then
 I feel good and that is stability. If it is not the right thought,
 I feel low and that is weakness
 ",SS,2
" So, stability is strength.
 ",SO,2
" If you are stable, you are strong. This strength will then
 shape the way you respond to situations. Like, you said, I want
 my child to have good marks. Okay, I want my child to have
 good marks but it is not necessary that this will happen every
 time. When he fails to get the marks I expect him to get or
 the marks he is capable of getting, what is my state of mind? I
 am upset. Is that good for me? No. Is that good for my child?
 No. Then why am I creating it? The marks did not create my
 feelings, rather I was the creator of what I felt.
 ",SS,2
" But I would have thought it was just normal to be upset
 and feel sad.
 ",SO,2
" Once I get upset, my child also gets upset. My child gets
 demotivated and I expect him to do well in that demotivated
 state of mind. The energy that i am giving to those around
 me is not positive, and that's why I am not fulfilling my
 responsibility in the right way. When my child gets less marks,
 my responsibility should be to first take charge of my mind
 I have to remain composed so that I don't react immediately
 by shouting at him. Next, my responsibility is to take care of
 his state of mind, and finally I carefully explain to him that he
 needs to study responsibly and get good marks the next time.
 ",SS,2
" So what we usually end up offering our child is the
 opposite. We deplete his energy, lower his self-esteem, an
 make him feel small. I think that's why suicides among
 children are prevalent today.
 ",SO,2
" A big reason why a child commits suicide is that he is not
 able to face his parents after the failure. It is not because he
 failed; it is because he doesn't want to see his parents unhappy
 and he holds himself responsible for their unhappiness. The
 parents had conditioned and pressured him throughout the 
 year that they would be happy only when he succeeded
 ",SS,2
" I thought it was my responsibility to see to it that my child
 achieved his goal - whether in studies, sports, or whatever
 else. I realize that I have been doing just the opposite.
 ",SO,2
" Every individual's life is based on four aspects: physical
 intellectual, emotional and spiritual. It is about my physical
 health, my intellectual development, my emotional state of
 being and my spiritual health. If I want to be successful in life
 and if I want my children to be successful in life - successful
 in the whole sense, then all the four aspects need to be equally
 balanced. When I consider my responsibilities toward my child, I
 take into account his academic performance and extracurricular
 performance, and I take care of his physical health. My child
 should get the best home, the best food, the best exercise and
 so on. With regard to his social well-being, I want him to have
 good friends and indulge in extracurricular activities. But how
 is my child feeling inside? We are not really considering and
 taking care of that aspect. Physically and academically he may
 be doing very well, but the constant pressure, the constant
 comparison with other people, and the constant criticism that
 he gets from his parents are actually depleting his emotional
 strength. So I have to ask myself whether I am fulfilling my
 responsibility. Tomorrow he could grow up to be a good doctor
 or a senior lawyer, and be physically very strong, but if he is
 emotionally not strong, will he be a good human being? And
 if he is not a good human being, a pure and powerful being
 will he really be happy?
 ",SS,2
" What happens if he is emotionally not very strong?
 ",SO,2
" If I am a good doctor, technically I am good. But if I am not emotionally strong, then I will get irritated very easily, I
 will react easily,I will not empathize with my patients and
 my colleagues. I will not get along with people because I am
 intolerant. Can I stil call myself a good doctor?
 While we were growing up they only taught us how to read,
 how to write, how to speak. No one taught us how to think.
 ",SS,2
" But that's what happens. We knew only
 about IQ; EQ came into the picture much later.
 ",SO,2
" There is no doubt that your IQ is important, but so is your
 emotional strength. The emotionally strong person can handle
 all struggles and challenges of life. With a strong IQ we need
 emotional strength to achieve success.
 ",SS,2
" When I was, growing up I remember that, adults often
 slapped children to teach them, even at schools. If they scored
 less marks, they felt scared to share those marks at home.
 ",SO,2
" Right. So we need to ask ourselves whether we are fulfilling
 all our responsibilities suitably. It is not enough to fulfil one
 responsibility by getting them to perform well. What about
 my second responsibility of making the child a strong human
 being? Life is going to present a lot of challenges. Today your
 child has passed with the highest marks and come first in
 class, but will his marks help him face all the challenges in life?
 ",SS,2
" Maybe emotionally he is so weak that he will not be
 able to compete with other things in life.
 ",SO,2
" Exactly. If he has to face even a small failure, he will not
 be able to cope up. What if he has to work with people with
 whom he cannot adjust? We did not take care of that aspect.
 Why? The prime reason is that we had not taken care of that
 aspect in our own lives. We ignored the importance of being
 emotionally healthy. We thought our responsibility is to take
 care of everything external, whether in our lives or the lives
 of those for whom we were responsible.
 ",SS,2
" Most men feel that their responsibility is to earn money
 and when they do that their job is done.

 because happiness is supposed to be coming from outside.
 ",SS,2
" We give them good toys, good clothes, good food, etc.,
 we have done our duty. Now if they don't study, that's their
 problem. We easily put it to sanskaras, their school, or peer
 pressure. We keep on blaming other people.
 ",SO,2
" Because you are not ready to take that responsibility. It's easy
 to earn and to send your child to the best school, to give him
 the best food and the best home, and the best of everything,
 but it's a huge challenge to make your child emotionally strong.
 ",SS,2
" The most important thing I have to realise is that first I
 have to be emotionally strong.
 ",SO,2
" So it's time to do that now. While taking care of our
 children we always need to remember, we can send our child
 to the best school without having gone to school ourselves.
 We can ensure that our children eat well, even if we sleep
 empty stomach. But it is not possible to make our children
 happy without being happy ourselves. You cannot make your
 child emotionally strong without being emotionally strong
 yourself, so that's where the responsibility comes to find it
 first in yourself.",SS,2
" I have been speaking to a few friends and they mentioned
 something called the u-stress meaning good stress. They
 say we need that kind of stress and tension. One of my
 friend's claims that he actually waits till he is stressed and
 time is less, because then he works best. How should one
 understand that?
 ",SO,3
" It's a belief system. It is something that we are hearing
 everywhere around us that unless there is stress I will
 not perform; if there is no stress I will become passive and
 laidback. They call it the drive to perform, to achieve. So we
 need to ask ourselves: is it really true? For that I need to ask
 myself what is this stress and how do I feel when I experience
 it. Imagine that I suddenly have a problem in my knee and it
 starts paining, I am still walking but is it the same as I was
 walking before, when everything was fine?
 ",SS,3
" No, there is pain now
 ",SO,3
" Naturally it's to going to be a little uncomfortable. However
 I say this is okay, or even accept it as a natural part of ageing.
 I keep walking and because I am not treating it or taking care
 of it, the pain is constantly there and at times it is aggravated.
 I am still managing my life, though. Now, suddenly I have to
 run because of some reason. Will I be able to run with that
 pain? I will not be able to. It's the same with stress. Stress
 is in my mind; it is a little pain in the way I feel. How do I
 feel when I experience stress? Even if I am not able to check
 myself at the emotional level, let's just check the physical or
 bodily parameters my heartbeat increases and so does my
 pulse rate, at times my mouth goes dry, I start getting a very
 uncomfortable feeling in the stomach, my head feels heavy, and so on. This is when the effect of the mind has already taken a
 toll on the body, and it is a much later stage. Some students
 fall ill on the day of their exams, with fever or nausea. Some
 people start sweating or their mouth goes dry before a public
 speech. This is the effect of the mind on the body.
 ",SS,3
" But I thought it was normal. The first time I was facing
 a camera, my mouth and lips had all gone dry.
 ",SO,3
" Did you perform better?
 ",SS,3
" No, it was very bad.
 ",SO,3
" Lets say a child has to sit for an exam. Exam is a target and
 a pressure. If he creates anxiety, does he perform better?
 I remember when we used to give our exams and come back
 and evaluate our own performance, we would point out places
 where we knew the answer but made mistakes. We referred to
 these as careless mistakes. What is a careless mistake? I know
 the answer but I have written something else. And why have
 I done it? Because there is no clarity, which is a state brought
 about by the presence of anxiety
 It's not carelessness. It has happened because I did not take
 care of my mind. So there is no clarity in thinking, decision-
 making power is affected, performance gets affected, my hands
 tremble, and my speed of writing slows down. I may even say
 that I didn't finish my exam
 ",SS,3
" So why do people say that they work best when they
 are stressed and tensed, and when the deadline is looming
 on their heads?
 ",SO,3
" Deadline means there is a target and target could be a
 pressure. Target means I have to do this by so and so time.
 If you remove that target I may take six days to complete the
 same task. The minute you set a target, I start working faster.
 Now, while I am working faster, what will happen if I start
 creating thoughts along these lines how will I finish it by
 tomorrow evening; if I don't finish it by tomorrow evening.
 what will the consequence be? Will I be thrown out of my
 job? Will my boss get angry with me? What if someone else
 finishes it before I do? Does that mean they will have a better
 chance for a promotion or a raise? If this happens, my career is finished! I am still performing, I am still working, but what is
 going on in the mind? What is going on in the mind is stress;
 negativity is the stress because it is creating an uncomfortable
 feeling. The target is fine. Two people are given the same
 target: they have to finish this job by tomorrow evening, both
 are set to achieve it and they will. This means both will reach
 destination but the journey will be different for each of
 them.
 One will think 'yes, I have to achieve this by tomorrow
 evening, I will have nothing else but this work on my mind,
 and I am going to do this. The second person will worry 'what if
 something happens', or 'what if I don't achieve this: So, one
 has reached the destination with stability, and the other has
 done the same by creating stress. The end result is externally
 the same, for both have performed, but internally the other
 person is totally fatigued. This other person will conveniently
 put blame on the pressure, and not realise that it is his own
 creation in the face of pressure.
 Stress in science has a simple formula:
 stress = pressure ÷ resilience
 Pressure, the numerator here, includes what's coming from
 outside targets, exams, relationships, situations, traffic jams,
 deadlines, etc. Resilience is my inner strength to face that
 pressure. Consider the simple metal sheets used in industrial
 applications. Different metal sheets are subjected to the same
 amount of pressure, but the stress factor of every metal is
 different because every metal sheet's power to face that pressure
 is different
 Now in the formula stress = pressure÷ resilience, we have
 conveniently ignored the denominator and embraced the
 conditioning of stress = pressure.
 Its ignored, because I am not ready to take responsibility
 of my inner strength. Hence, for me stress = pressure. If I
 have an exam, obviously I will get tensed. If my boss is very
 tough, obviously it is going to be a challenge for me because
 stress = pressure.
 ",SS,3
" Do you think people like to be stressed? Why do we
 accept it easily?
 ",SO,3
" When I am not able to tackle it, I just say it's natural or
 inevitable.
 ",SS,3
" You mean to say it takes effort to not be stressed and
 be happy in the situation?
 ",SO,3
" Yes! Suppose you say something to me that is not pleasant.
 To get hurt is so easy
 ",SS,3
" Even at my age, I tend to think it's so natural to blame
 others for how we feel.
 ",SO,3
" The weather changes. It's summer today, a couple months
 later it will be winter. The weather changes and it gets chilly.
 Do you say it's natural to fall ill since the weather has changed?
 No! You open the cupboard and take out the woollens and
 protect yourself.
 We don't keep blaming the weather, do we? We protect
 ourselves. Things are going to happen outside but because we
 have not learnt the mechanism of how to protect ourselves,
 we say it is natural to fall ill. It's natural to get hurt, to get
 stressed, that's what we say.
 Spirituality focusses on the denominator, that is resilience.
 The pressure or the situation is not in my control. So the
 numerator is not in my control. In any situation we can attribute
 10% to the numerator, but the remaining 90% depends on my
 power to cope. Because if there is no pressure, then there will
 be no stress, so we give 10% responsibility to the pressure. The
 remaining 90% is about the extent I take charge of how I am
 going to handle that pressure.
 ",SS,3
" So, how I react to something is 90%. Somebody just hits
 my car if it's an old car, I don't really get that upset; but
 if it's a brand new one, I react. What do you say?
 ",SO,3
" How you react is your choice. Someone has hit your car
 - the situation was not in your control. Now, you have two
 ways to respond: 1) Get out of the car, create a scene, shout
 at him, hit him, abuse him, have him respond in the same
 manner, and have ten more people in the scene, or 2) wish
 him good morning and a nice day
 ",SS,3
" And the other choice is to just smile and say it's okay.
 In any case your car is insured.
 ",SO,3
" Yes! More important is the insurance of the mind. You
 claim insurance and your car is repaired. But for the damage
 that gets done inside you every time a situation arises, where
 is the insurance for that and where are the repairs?
 ",SS,3
" I am more concerned that my car is damaged.
 ",SO,3
" The car is more important than my happiness on my
 responsibility list, because I thought the car was my source of
 happiness. Only when I make my state of being as my priority
 will I start taking care of myself. First check if you are okay,
 then check if everything outside of you is okay.
 ",SS,3
" If you don't help yourself, how can you help others?
 But isn't this being a bit selfish?
 ",SO,3
" If I don't take care of myself, can I help you? All my time
 and energy is spent in taking care of other people. What's the
 result? Today I am under stress, and so are my children. Earlier,
 depression was something that affected people when they were
 60 and above; today we have school children with so many
 issues and are frequenting counsellors and psychiatrists. If we
 were fulfilling our responsibilities, this wouldn't be the result.
 ",SS,3
" We often say that the teachers are irresponsible, the
 politicians are irresponsible, but thinking inwards I am the
 most irresponsible person especially by not being responsible
 for myself.
 ",SO,3
" First I have to be responsible. The ability to respond is
 responsibility. My ability to respond in every situation is response + ability = responsibility
 Imagine the irony of life - we are always trying to control
 things that are not in our control, while ignoring the one
 thing that is in our control. We say, 'oh, my mind is not in my
 control, but that is the only thing that is in one's control. Going
 back to the matter of two cars bumping into each other - if
 you suggest to people that you can just say okay, never mind
 and drive away, they might not agree. They strongly feel that
 it is important to get out of the car and shout at the one who
 made the mistake. You try and explain to them that it will be
 damaging for them, that is they will be hurting themselves.
 They will say but what about making the other person realise
 their mistake.
 ",SS,3
" So that he won't repeat the mistake again. I am doing
 him a favour.
 ",SO,3
" You see I am more interested in teaching others rather
 than taking care of myself. Whether it's a small situation or
 a big one, I have a choice of how I am going to respond. Let
 me just sit back and be aware in every situation. If I just say
 it's okay and drive on, how do I feel on that day?
 ",SS,3
" I would feel nice about it.
 ",SO,3
" Because you have conserved energy and conquered your own
 weakness. So it is something that has to be experimented with.
 ",SS,3
" The other day I was going to the airport and somebody
 banged my car. My driver was just about to get out and fight,
 but I asked him to keep quiet, close the door and ignore
 the other person. I felt nice about it. Right now, conversing
 with you, I realize I felt nice because I kind of conquered
 my weakness that has been there for years and years.
 ",SO,3
" Also, you had the right thoughts at that moment, so you
 felt better. If you create the thought that 'it's okay, it's just an
 accident, move on now' it's a positive thought. It's a good
 feeling. But if I have thoughts like - why didn't he look where
 he was driving; he should have been driving carefully; who
 gives them their driving license; they think they own the road
 - how are you going to feel after that? The thoughts you have
 will determine your feelings. Then, after all this we reach our
 destination, maybe we were headed to our workplace.
 ",SS,3
" And for how long will this kind of mood and the
 agitation remain?
 ",SO,3
" Let's say I have to drive for about half an hour to work. So
 the mood will stay with me for about half an hour. However, the
 unfortunate part is, within the next half an hour, there will be
 another situation. By that time my emotional immunity system
 is already low and the chances of me reacting has increased.
 Next I reach my office and my receptionist is not there on her
 desk.... She has not come to office on time. Now yet another
 situation confronts me. I go to my desk and see that the office
 boy has not cleaned my table properly. One more situation. My
 junior has not completed his work, which was supposed to be
 there on my desk at 10 o' clock in the morning. So, situation
 after situation unfolds, and I keep reacting. Every time I justify
 my reaction by saying it is because of....
 ",SS,3
" ...this, this, this. I am right, I didn't do anything but
 this happened, and it is natural.
 ",SO,3
" If you react, you are wasting and depleting your energy;
 you are reducing your emotional strength. When you encounter
 the next situation you will be weaker than before.
 ",SS,3
" Over a period of time it also becomes a habit. Then
 you get high blood pressure and heart problems start an
 so on. It takes a toll on our health.
 ",SO,3
" Today we say high blood pressure is natural because the
 stress is natural, and the by-product of this stress will also
 be natural. So everything that was unnatural gets labelled as
 natural. And then we say we want happiness
 ",SS,3
" Tell me, what is the meaning of unlimited?
 ",SO,3
" That which is not dependent on any limited object, people
 or situation. It's state of being is unlimited, unconditional,
 and independent. It is free of dependencies and, therefore,
 free of the fear of failure. Whenever there is dependency on
 someone or something, the second thought instantly will be
 of fear. What if I don't get it? I have immediately created
 fear and as I create fear, the happiness is gone. You will find
 people fearing happiness too when everyone in the house is
 happy, someone will say 'don't be so happy, you never know
 what's going to happen next'. They are so fearful that they are
 scared to be happy today.
 ",SS,3
" Everything is temporary.
 ",SO,3
" Because it's all dependent on situations. Today the situation is
 favourable, so you are happy, but you don't know what the next
 situation is going to be. But, if your happiness is independent
 of situations, then you can be happy 24 x 7
 ",SS,3
" You think we can be happy 24 x 7?
 ",SO,3
" It's possible and we can do it, but first we have to take care
 of ourselves and take self-responsibility. But if it depends on
 outside factors then it is occasional. The more the situations
 become challenging; the more people's behaviours become
 unpredictable. It becomes a struggle and that is why we start
 accepting stress as natural, whereas it is happiness that is natural",SS,3
" I read an article in a newspaper recently, which said
 'Peace feels happiness. What comes first, peace or happiness?
 Can you be at peace if you are not happy? The answer to these
 questions depends on your idea of happiness, on whether
 you get happiness from external factors or from within.'
 ",SO,4
" Yes, but this is not the first time that we are reading about
 this. We read and hear about it often, but what happens at
 the stage of practical implementation? We read about the
 subject every day in the newspaper, in the spiritual column,
 in self-help books. Today the largest-selling books are on the
 topics of self-help and positive-thinking, self-motivation, self-
 development and spirituality. Seminars and workshops, too
 are organised often. Yet, what's on the rise is stress, anger and
 anxiety and unlimited unhappiness. So that's the question
 mark - even though knowledge is everywhere, and there is
 realization as well, I am looking for happiness outside. This
 means we haven't taken knowledge and internalised it. Instead,
 we are accepting stress as natural. So there is a huge difference
 between what I know, what I am studying, what I believe, and
 what I am implementing
 ",SS,4
" You mean to say we do not believe in what we read
 ",SO,4
" It's not a part of our belief system yet. Stress is natural
 it's a belief system and has developed over a period of time,
 right from our childhood. As a child, we had our parents
 saying, aren't you tensed, you have an exam tomorrow; how
 can you be so relaxed?' So it's a belief system that developed
 and got entrenched while I was growing up, and reinforced by society which said obviously stress is natural with so much
 competition around you. So it's a deep-rooted belief system
 and we have lived with it.
 Then I read somewhere that 'happiness is your internal
 way of living, it's your internal way of being, it's how you
 choose. But it doesn't change the belief system; I just read it
 and carried on with my life as I had been doing all along.I
 say it doesn't work in practical life, and that's where workshops,
 spirituality and religion get separated from my practical life. I go to
 a retreat, attend a management workshop or a spiritual
 programme, and listen to something that is very pure and
 powerful. While I am listening to it, I absolutely agree that it
 is true. Then when I come back, I am still my old self and say
 those things don't work here. It was okay for those people to
 say what they did, but they are not in my circumstances. We
 don't even try, we don't experiment. We think it will happen
 automatically. Well, it won't. Whatever I have studied and
 whatever I have understood, I will have to put in a little effort
 at applying it. Now I have understood that anger is unnatural
 that it is a response I create; so when I come to my workplace
 or spend time with my family, I will have to take care that
 I do not react the next time someone does something that
 according to me is not right.
 ",SS,4
" You remind me of my Guru. I used to ask her about the
 way to attain peace, but did not get a direct answer. I was
 someone who did not know the meaning of peace. Waiting
 for the lift, I used to keep pressing the button till it reached
 me. I was a restless man all the time and I said I wanted
 peace. Your words remind me of that line she said, 'you
 ask me every time about peace, but do you do any karmas
 of peace?' I could not relate to what she was saying. When
 I went outside I saw that somebody had parked his car in
 front of mine. I wanted to kick that car. I opened my car
 door and wanted to honk, and I remembered what she had
 said inside, about doing karmas of peace.
 ",SO,4
" I want peace but I think it has to come from outside.
 Similarly, I want happiness, I want love, and so on. Want
 means that someone, somewhere has to do something so that
 I will get it. On the other hand, spirituality teaches us that I
 am peace. I have to be at peace while I am doing everything.
 I am a blissful being; I am a love-full being.
 ",SS,4
" But if I am, then why do I want?
 ",SO,4
" Because I have forgotten that I am. It's like the keys in your
 pocket or the spectacles on your head. You may be looking
 for them everywhere and even get others to join you in that
 search. 'Come on, everyone, look for my keys. Where are my
 keys?' You look for it everywhere except where they actually are.
 ",SS,4
" How does one realize or even begin to understand that
 I am peace? How do you prove this?
 ",SO,4
" By experimenting. Everything is a belief, we experiment
 with it, and if we get the result, we take it as the truth. Keep
 searching for peace, for thats the purpose of life'. If the purpose
 of life is to keep searching for peace, then when will we find it?
 But now we understand this is our nature. Let me experiment
 a peaceful being. Now I will use this awareness in every
 act that I do, with every person I meet. Every interaction I have
 today, I will only remember that I am the one who is doing
 it. Think of a doctor. He knows he is a doctor, so if someone
 meets with an accident while he is there on the road, he will
 immediately get into the healing job. But if the doctor forgets
 that he is a doctor, even if there are people dying around him
 he won't do anything because he has forgotten he is a doctor. So
 healing won't come into action. But the minute he remembers
 again that I am a doctor, he will start healing. So it's about
 remembrance. I am a peaceful being was forgotten. Because it
 was forgotten, I was looking for peace outside. Now try a new
 belief system. Try - it's still not the truth, it's only a belief Just
 experiment with it. If we get the result, then it is the truth.
 ",SS,4
" How will you experiment?
 ",SO,4
" I go back to work today and find that there is a situation.
 I just remind myself that I am a peaceful being and then act.
 ",SS,4
" I just keep on at this like a mantra.' I am a peaceful being.
 I am a peaceful being. A peon comes and says something
 that disturbs me and I shout shut up: Again, I am angry
 Then I start the mantra again, I am peaceful being
 ",SO,4
" It's not a mantra, it's a conviction. I am telling myself who
 I am and then preparing myself. Everything that I do will
 be out of this consciousness. This is who I am. It's a simple
 thing. Let us say there is a space here in the mind. I think it
 is empty and say I want happiness, I want peace and I want
 love. I go to everyone expecting that they will fill my space.
 Please do this so that I will be happy. Please talk to me nicely
 so that I will be peaceful. This is one way of living life; this is
 one belief system. The other belief system is that my space is
 full but now I have to go through the whole day taking care
 that its contents don't spill out. That's all - it's full but I have
 to take care of it. This is the journey; this is what Awakening
 is all about. It is about understanding
 that this is who I am, that now I am peaceful. I just have to
 remember that while I am talking to you its contents should
 not spill out.
 ",SS,4
" I am peaceful. The moment I am not peaceful, it spills
 out?

 way is: I am happy and now I will do this.

" I am happy and I will try to make you happy too.
 ",SO,4
" I don't know whether I will be able to make other peopie
 happy because that is another deep-rooted belief system.
 ",SS,4
" What I mean is, when you are around a happy person,
 you also feel happy because the atmosphere is happy.
 ",SO,4
" True, but someone can be around a happy person and
 still be very sad unless they take charge of their thoughts and
 feelings. This is again a deep-rooted belief system that we can
 make others happy; no one can make the other happy unless
 they want to be happy themselves
 ",SS,4
" Then no one can make you sad too.
 ",SO,4
" Absolutely, and that is what it means when I say that I
 am not dependent on other people for my emotions and my
 feelings. The most established belief system is - 'Happiness' is
 dependent on other people.
 ",SS,4
" What does love do to people? She makes me happy, he
 makes me happy.
 ",SO,4
" When I am with this person, I have nice thoughts and
 that's why I tell myself I am happy when I am with this
 person. Then I tell myself that this person makes me happy.
 This is how we also depend on objects - whether a car or
 a piece of jewellery - to create similar kinds of thoughts
 We use these as stimulus to create a particular kind of thought.
 Between the stimulus and the response is my freedom to
 choose my response. I have the freedom to decide how I am
 going to respond. Today you talk to me nicely and I am very
 happy; tomorow you do something that according to me is
 not right, and I am hurt. But you are still the same.

 was speaking to you nicely. I am the same person but my
 behaviour is changed, so you will be shocked by this changed
 behaviour

 always going to behave the way I want you to?

 myself to believe that this is right and this is wrong. I want
 people to be right so that I will be happy.

 behaviour, so that you see me as always being nice to you
 I should behave as you want me to?
 ",SO,4
" Because then I will be happy.
 ",SS,4
" So are you controlling me?
 ",SO,4
" Yes, I am controlling you, and that's what we are doing
 everyday with people. We are doing that with our little
 children, with everyone around us. We want them to be or
 do or perform or behave in a particular manner because that
 will make us happy.
 Which I think is right, which I think is the way to be. I
 feel what I think is right and what the other person is doing
 is wrong, and then my happiness becomes dependent on that.

" That's fine. But my state of mind experiences pain or
 happiness being dependent on the other person's behaviour.

 don't call me, I am hurt. Why? Since my happiness is dependent
 on your behaviour

 to everybody and not to me, then I will feel hurt.

 ",SS,4

 ",SO,4
" You have a choice. Okay, she did not call me up, though
 I thought she should have. I could still be stable by creating
 different thoughts. I could create the thought that she
 was busy, or that she did not feel like talking to me at
 that time.
 ",SS,4
" I think I have got the answer. One of my friends was
 telling me this incident. He had just reached his house and
 saw that it was locked. He had come from an enlightening
 seminar where there were discussions about various aspects
 of life. When he saw the locked house, in his usual mood he
 would have just broken the lock in anger. Instead, he went
 to his daughter's house, which was just next door, picked up
 the spare key and opened the door. Just as he went inside,
 his wife returned. He wanted to confront her first about the
 locked house, but instead asked her where she had been. She
 said she had been to the market and had tried to contact
 him, but his phone was switched off. He realised that he
 had switched off the phone while the seminar was going on
 This meant that she was right and so was he.
 ",SO,4
" Absolutely. Everyone is always right. It's not important
 whether they are right or they are wrong. First of all I have
 to be right - not do right but BE right. This means I first take
 care of myself and this will only happen when I gradually bring
 myself out of this mental conditioning that my state of mind
 is dependent on other people. How many people have we held
 responsible for our pain? Every time we hold other people
 responsible, we are telling ourselves it's their fault, and I am
 fine the way I am. But I have to understand that people are
 doing what they are doing; they could be cheating on me but
 the pain is my creation. Let's say you are my business partner
 and you have cheated on me, but the hurt, the resentmernt
 and the hatred that I feel are my creation. You cheated me
 financially and ethically, and that's where your power ends
 That's where the power of anybody outside ends, whether its
 a business partner, a spouse, or a child.
 Our thoughts, feelings and responses are OUR choice
 ",SS,4
" But something keeps troubling me inside.... Why can't
 I get back at him for what he has done?
 ",SO,4
" Let's say your business partner cheated on you and you
 parted ways. But now you want to do the same business that
 he is doing, with the thought, 'I want to come into the market
 as his competitor and I want to take my revenge. I believe
 I am right.' So you parted ways since your partner did not
 conduct himself in an ethical manner. But you want to now
 start a business with the feeling of taking revenge is this the
 kind of energy that you want to bring into your new work?
 Is this your thought process while starting the new venture?
 This you have to ask yourself. How you are going to think and
 feel is your choice. You are hurt and for how long you will
 remain hurt is also your choice. You want to live with your
 pain for 10 minutes, 10 days, or 10 years, is your choice. You
 can sit back, think of the situation, and relive the pain again
 and again, even years after it happened. Who is the creator of
 these emotions? It's you. In the same situation, different people
 will create different responses. So this has to be experimented
 with at every step

" So if my wife didn't call me when I expected her to,
 maybe she was busy or my phone was off, but the mind
 goes on thinking about it. What is that?

" But it's my mind, so who is creating the thoughts? I am.
 Look at yourself creating those thoughts. She should have
 called me; I was waiting for her call. So you sit back and just
 change your thoughts gradually. She didn't feel like talking to
 me at that time. It was her choice.
 ",SS,4
" She should be happy when she speaks to me, that's what
 my mind says.
 ",SO,4
" Yes, because I like people to be dependent on me. I am
 dependent too. It's this control that gives me power. I am empty
 inside and I love this idea of people being dependent on me.
 I think I am more powerful because people are dependent on
 me for feeling good. Because I am dependent on other people,
 I feel other people should also be dependent on me for feeling
 happy; how could she be happy without talking to me because
 I am not happy without talking to her? We are trapped, and
 we are trapping other people into being dependent on us. And
 all this is happening in the name of love and respect and trust,

 that we do not respond it's like you are saying something to
 me and I am just a stone wall with no thoughts, feelings and
 emotions. That's not right. The question is which thoughts,
 which feelings, which emotions? It's not that I either react or
 don't respond at all; reaction means an automated response.

 have to say sorry to people?

 not being comfortable with the way I reacted. Normally what
 happens is that we measure, like you said overreacted. This
 means we are always measuring our reactions with reference
 to the other person's behaviour. If you shout at me, I double
 shout; why? We are always doing it with reference to other
 people. My personality should be mine, my responses should
 be mine, and my way of talking should be mine, irrespective
 of the other person. If I keep changing with reference to
 everyone I meet, then there will be nothing left in me that
 is of my own

 you and move away. I am cold at this particular moment, due
 to whatever reason - it may be my nature, my state of mind
 because of something that had happened. Maybe I am not
 courteous and because of me you give up your quality as well.
 Next, you meet someone else who behaves differently and then
 you give up another quality. You meet someone who shouts
 at you and you give up your quality of sweetness. We absorb
 their negativity and give up our quality.

 something in return?

 was rude

 We speak about our mind as if it was something different from
 us. We are not ready to take responsibility of our mind, saying
 it is not in my control. It's like a parent who has given up on
 their child. Someone comes and says 'your child is not behaving
 properly,' and you reply sorry, my child is not in my control,
 please take care of my child. But because my mind is not in
 my control, I try to control your mind. If you say something
 to me right now and I am not able to control my mind, then
 I try to control you. I say, 'is this the way to speak, because
 I am not able to tell my mind 'is this is the way to think. So

" In India, when a girl gets married and comes to her
 husband's home, sometimes the husband's family expects
 her to quit her job and be at home. I have met a lot of
 women who quit their jobs and gave up their careers. Why?
 Because my husband and his family felt that I should not
 be working. To make them happy I gave up my career; it's
 been 20 years. But even after 20 years, they are still not
 happy. So it's a question mark for the girl. She sacrificed so
 much, gave up everything that she had studied; sat at home
 for 20 years for them; and the family is still not happy with
 her. The woman gets frustrated. As a newly married young
 girl, when she came into the family it was projected that the
 family would be happy when she quit her job. To make them happy she quit her job, but in the inside she was not happy
 about the decision.
 ",SS,5
" They thought that if their daughter-in-law doesn't work,
 they will be happy. Maybe they are unhappy because of
 some other reason

" They are not unhappy because of another reason. She has
 done this to make them happy, but she has been unhappy
 since the day she gave it all up. She is staying in the same
 house for 20 years; she chose not to work, but chose it for
 their happiness. Its not a choice that she made for herself. She
 has done what they wanted, but she is not happy doing it, so
 what's the energy that she has been sending to them for the
 last 20 years? I am unhappy, I am unhappy because of you
 all' So, how can they be happy?
 ",SS,5
" You mean how can they be happy when she is sending
 them constant negative energy?
 ",SO,5
" And this is where the secret lies. I cannot make other
 people happy by doing anything for them. If I choose to do
 something for them, I have to be sure that I am happy first
 while doing it - otherwise, I shouldn't do it.
 ",SS,5
" But aren't there certain things to be done whether you
 are happy or not happy, because they are part of our duties?
 ",SO,5
" You will do the act but you will not give the right energy.
 Its like I give you a gift, it's my duty to give you the gift, but
 when I give it to you, I am upset and uninterested. You won't
 be happy, you won't even look at the gift because what you
 are going to get is the energy of the giver. So I did this for you but what was the energy that I was creating while I was
 doing it? Relationships are not actions; relationships are the
 energies that we exchange while doing those actions. So if it's
 my duty, I first convince my mind why I am doing it and then
 I tell the mind that, I am choosing to do this. I am doing this
 because these people matter to me.' Create the right thought
 and the right energy first before you do something, otherwise
 it is best to leave it.
 ",SS,5
" What is the meaning of duty?
 ",SO,5
" Responsibility. We are living with people, and they have
 certain expectations of how they want me to be and what
 they want me to do. I consider it my responsibility and my
 pure desire to make them happy, so I do what they want me
 to do. But if I do it unhappily, it will not get me the desired
 results. Moreover, because I am doing it for them, very soon
 I will be expecting them to do something for me.
 ",SS,5
" It's very difficult for me to understand this.
 ",SO,5

 priorities through the day; I have to DO this, I have to DO
 that. The focus has rarely been I have to BE like this.

" Let's say for homework, children say I have to do so
 much work. Isn't that correct?
 ",SO,5
" Yes, they have to do it, but care has to be on how they are
 feeling while doing it. They need to be calm, peaceful, happy,
 and then do it. Lets say I have to run from here to there; I
 have to be healthy to do it. If I am not healthy and I try to
 run, the journey will be tiresome, painful and a struggle. Now
 for everything that I am doing the whole day, my whole life, if
 I am emotionally healthy, then whatever I do will be beautiful
 ",SS,5
" So how should we be emotionally healthy?
 ",SO,5
" That's an important aspect. It's important to understand
 that this is an aspect of my life which we have taken for
 granted, which we thought will happen on its own; which we
 thought other people will take care of. We always thought - I
 am supposed to make you happy and you are supposed to
 make me happy.
 ",SS,5
" So often I have heard people saying 'when I get married
 I will be very happy, I am tired of my mother, brothers and
 sisters.' As it turns out, they are not happy when they get
 married also and it's back to square one. That's why I asked
 you this question: how and what to do to be emotionally
 balanced and stable and to be happy in almost all conditions?
 ",SO,5
" There are people who are not happy in their marriages and
 looking for relationships outside their marriage
 ",SS,5
" Then they break that as well and go to the third one.
 ",SO,5
" Because we thought happiness has to come from the other
 person. So we kept searching.
 ",SS,5
" So finally we come to the conclusion that happiness
 cannot come from outside at all. We have been working so
 hard in the wrong direction. We went to temples, we did
 social work, went shopping, watched movies, parties, alcohol
 each time we only wanted to be happy. Now we have to work
 the other way round.
 ",SO,5
" See, whenever I take the mind to something else, what
 happens? I am watching a television show or a movie. What
 happens? Whatever was going on in my mind has been put
 off for some time. Suppose you have a toothache and you start
 watching a movie, very soon you will forget the toothache.
 When you switch off the TV, the pain seems to start again.
 What happened? Does it mean that the tooth was healed and
 now it's again hurt? No, it was always in pain but the mind
 was distracted. My tooth is paining and I am aware of the
 pain. Who is aware of the pain? The mind is. Then I take my
 mind to something else, whether it's a conversation, a shopping
 trip, or a television programme. I feel the pain is gone but it
 is not - it's just that I am not aware of the pain. Then, when
 the TV is switched off, I can feel the pain again. Now this is
 the case of a physical pain, same is when there is an emotional
 pain. The whole day was tough, I created a lot of stress and
 anxiety; then I say let's go for a movie, 'let's go for a holiday.
 'let's take a break from here and go away for 15 days.
 ",SS,5
" Is it escapism?
 ",SO,5
" It's just that we are trying to take the mind away from there.
 ",SS,5
" Shall we call it temporary happiness?
 ",SO,5
" Not happiness, it's a temporary deviation of the mind from
 the truth. It's not happiness because we are coming back to it
 after sometime. See, we can call it happiness if it was healed;
 your tooth was not healed, it was just that you were not aware
 of the pain.
 ",SS,5
" So why do we go for holidays, picnics, movies and all
 that?
 ",SO,5
" It's a change: it's entertainment; it's different from the routine.
 Let's just be aware of our thoughts and let's not try and
 deviate our mind to something else in the pursuit of happiness.
 We are suppressing the conscious mind by getting distracted and
 then thinking that this will bring us happiness. The minute the
 distraction is removed, my conscious mind is back there and
 it is back with probably more pain. So I need to take charge;
 this is not the solution, this is just running away from the
 problem. But for how long can we run away? How long can
 we be on a holiday? Finally, I am going to be back at work.",SS,5
" I read somewhere that peace and happiness almost
 go hand-in-hand. The writer says there is peace in the
 smile of a child, in the tender touch of one's mother;
 it has got nothing to do with God or religion but
 everything to do with the state of one's mind.
 ",SO,6
" Absolutely. In both the instances, the author is talking
 about the vibrations of the being. The smile of the child
 emanates vibrations of purity and innocence, and the touch
 of the mother has vibrations of love and unconditional
 acceptance. When we experience these gestures, more than
 the act, it is the vibration in the energy that we experience
 and that's why there is peace. And wherever there is peace,
 there will be happiness
 ",SS,6
" So the mother and the child are so natural. For elders
 you have to make an effort.
 ",SO,6
" That's what it's all about; about making it natural. The effort
 happens when you are trying to do it for the other person
 while the natural is when you are just being yourself. If I am
 trying to do things according to what I think will make you
 happy, then it is an effort; but if I am just being myself, then
 it's natural
 ",SS,6
" You mean to say being myself or being natural is
 peace, love and happiness.
 ",SO,6
" Yes. I just have to be in that awareness that these are my
 natural qualities. These are not qualities that I will acquire
 when I do something; it's my natural personality, my natural
 sanskar. It's my original state of being: I just have to remember
 it and let it flow not look for it outside

 a December-born,' 'I am a January-born,' 'I am a Leo,' 'I
 am a Taurus,' I am a so-and-so.' I am a short-tempered

 easy to attribute things to one's birth and say 'I am like

 ",SO,6
" There's a very beautiful word in Hindi - sanskars. It's the
 personality trait. Every being carries five types of sanskars and
 that's why it's important to understand the being, because
 it is a package made up of these five types of sanskars. The
 first set of sanskars we get from the family. We are within
 the vibration of the family members, so that energy is
 automatically influencing us. The second set of sanskars
 comes from my environment, my country, my religion, caste,
 city, school and friends. We have always heard - you will be
 coloured by the company you keep. The environment and
 the people around you, the energy around you, the belief
 systems around you, these create sanskars.
 The third type of sanskar is sanskars of the past. When l
 understand that I am a spiritual being and so I don't die - I
 just change costumes and my journey is through each and every costume. Then there are certain sets of sanskars which I
 have created in my past costumes. Today I am in this costume,
 I am doing a lot of actions, its creating an impression, it's
 creating a sanskar. It's time to leave this body but the sanskars
 don't get erased, it's like a recording of songs on the CD which
 was created and you take that CD and put it on another
 every costume player, you are still carrying those songs.
 ",SS,6
" Let's forget about past life since we don't know how
 many of us believe in it.
 ",SO,6
" It's not about believing in it; it's because we don't understand
 it that we have a lot of conflicts today. You know, the biggest
 conflict today in a family is that parents expect all their children
 to be the same, Oh, I have given the same upbringing to both
 my children, then why are they so different. The parents are
 same, the family is same, the environment is same, so they
 naturally expect the sanskars of all the children to be the same
 Yet, two children can be twins, born under the same zodiac
 sign, on the same date and at the same place, and they may
 go to the same school, grow up in the same environment,
 their personalities will be different. Because few years
 back when they were in two different costumes, they were
 not in the same family, they were not in the same country,
 they were not in the same environment. They have had
 different past, and they are carrying their pasts. We cannot
 ignore the fact of the past life's sanskars because they are a
 dominant factor in determining the present. We are not
 able to understand people because we are only seeing them
 in their present costume; we are unable to see that they are
 carrying a past.
 ",SS,6
" It's a nice way for parents to understand their child.
 ",SO,6
" We keep saying, 'look at your brother, you should be
 like him.' We don't understand that they are two different
 personalities like the two CDs with two different recordings,
 which have come to our house and we are trying to make
 one similar to the other.
 ",SS,6
" I have heard mothers telling their children, 'look at
 the other boy and look at you; I often doubt that you are
 my child; you may have been replaced in the hospital
 How hurting these words must be.
 ",SO,6
" She fails to understand from where her child has got
 the sanskars that she hasn't given to the child. It's tough for
 the child too, because even he doesn't know why he has
 these sanskars. For example, a child could have a sanskar of
 stealing. He comes from a wealthy family and has everything
 at home, yet when he goes to school he will pick up another
 child's pencil. It's something that comes instinctively to
 him; he doesn't do it logically. That's because the being,
 the spiritual energy, the soul has carried some sanskars. When
 we are unaware, the sanskars will come into play automatically.
 ",SS,6
" It's difficult to reach this level of
 awareness. Often there is such a small gap between a
 thing happening and my reaction. In that split second
 will I remember that I should not react like this? I
 used to see, many Guru, there would be a huge explosion during
 Diwali and his eye would not even blink. How do
 we reach that stage?
 ",SO,6
" It comes with attention and practice. Earlier if I was
 conducting a workshop and somebody's mobile phone rang,
 I would get disturbed. There I was talking to the gathering
 about stability, but inside I was disturbed.
 ",SS,6
" So it was one step leading to another? Earlier you were
 disturbed, another time you must have said, 'it's okay,
 they are like that' Next time, you are not even bothered
 if they are 'like that' or not; it really doesn't matter to
 you. It doesn't distract you anymore. Aren't these the
 stages then? One has to go through stages; one cannot
 go straight to your stage.
 ",SO,6
" Some people will say 'it's going to take years and years.
 No, it doesn't take years, it's just one thought of awareness
 otherwise I can get irritated by a mobile phone for a lifetime.
 We can live our lives getting irritated by the mobiles that are
 ringing around us.
 ",SS,6
" What is the meaning of one thought of awareness?
 ",SO,6
" One thought is 'How can I allow one unimportant
 ringtone to disturb my mind?' This is just one thought.
 I don't think about the opposite person because it is not the
 ringtone that disturbs us; it's the thoughts that I create
 alter listening to the ringtone. Why did they not switch off their
 mobiles? Don't they know that they are in a public programme?
 It's courtesy that you switch off your mobile. So it's not the
 ringtone that irritates me; it's the thoughts that I create
 in response to the ringtone that irritate me. The ringtone
 is just a trigger. I have to realize what is disturbing me. It is
 my own thoughts. My thought is that they should be polite
 enough to switch off the phone. Now I change my thought
 it's their choice, whether they want to switch it off or
 and I respect their choice.
 ",SS,6
" I used to get disturbed even if somebody walked in
 front of me while I was acting my scene. Now I can see
 so many people moving around, and now I am learning
 to accept it
 ",SO,6
" Now this is where we are creating the fourth type of
 sanskar. Getting irritated was one of the past sanskars,
 whether it came from the past birth, or from the current
 environment. With awareness we can change our sanskar.
 This is creating sanskars with our own will power. So we
 cannot keep blaming - oh, I can't help it, this must be a past
 sanskar. It's all about awareness.
 ",SS,6
" You are saying that awareness will bring will power.
 ",SO,6
" Yes. It's will power that I will use to create a new sanskar
 See, every time I say 'this is because of you'; I am getting
 irritated because of this'; I imply that I am not powerful and
 others can overpower me. Will power means I have the power
 to choose, to think and be and do what I want. Every time I
 use that power, it's will power. Many times we feel we don't
 have will power. Everyone has power, everyone has the same
 amount of will power; it just depends on how much we are
 going to use it. It depends on how we are going to sit back
 and stop blaming others. We disempower ourselves by not
 using our will power.
 ",SS,6
" I met someone who took two days to quit his habit
 of drinking of 30 years. You mean to say I have the same
 amount of will power as him? If yes, then what is it that
 I am unable to see that I have will power or what is it
 that's stopping me from using it?
 ",SO,6
" It's simple: I am not using it. A human quality is useful
 only if it is being used.
 ",SS,6
" But what if I don't know whether I have a quality
 or not? I don't know how to see or use the quality.
 ",SO,6
" That's why we are learning. It's that area of life on which
 we now start focusing attention. If we say we don't have time
 for spirituality; we don't have time to meditate; then we are
 choosing not to use the powers that we have. We are choosing
 not to apply the tools that are there.
 It's like I have a whole lot of property in my locker but
 I am refuse to open it and use it for myself and helping
 others; rather, I go around begging people for love, peace and
 happiness because I don't want to use the time to go into my
 own locker, open it and use it from there.
 ",SS,6
" So your locker is meditation?
 ",SO,6
" It's here in the mind and the key is with us, and only we
 know how to open it.
 ",SS,6
" So there is no need to go to anyone for getting my
 locker opened, for developing my powers.
 ",SO,6
" If we go somewhere, somebody out there could be
 instrumental in telling us how to open it, but finally no one
 else can open it for us. No one can activate the will power
 for us; that someone can only help us realize that we have
 this power. A simple example is when we want to give up
 our addictions. Someone may want to give up alcohol,
 cut down their TV watching time, or Internet surfing. We
 create a powerful positive thought,
 Today I will watch TV only for an hour.' We are aware
 of this positive thought we create, but we are not aware of so
 many negative thoughts we create immediately, It is difficult
 for me .. I love watching TV.. I have tried many times
 but I always fail. 
 It's my habit. Can't go in one day .. Obviously
 it will take time. Now we created one positive thought to
 empower ourselves, and then followed by so many negative
 thoughts which will disempower us. Once you have decided
 to do something, just create one single thought and start
 working on it.
 ",SS,6
" If we all have the same will power, then how is it
 that some are able to give up their addictions sooner
 than others.
 ",SO,6
" Everyone has equal will power because everyone is a powerful
 being; realizing my own will power depends on how much
 am aware that I am a powerful being and how much I use it
 Of course, the people around me also make a difference
 You know, we are largely responsible for reducing the will
 power of those around us, especially our children. Let's say
 your child spends too much time on the Internet and you
 tell him that from tomorrow he is going to be on it only for
 an hour. Your words are affirmative, but your thoughts are
 of doubt and failure in giving up the addiction.
 ",SS,6
" Internally I am so sure that my child will not be
 able to do it.
 ",SO,6
" Every thought that I create is the energy that I am
 showing or radiating to the child
 ",SS,6
" But why should the child get disturbed by the energy
 of the parent?
 ",SO,6
" We get influenced by the thoughts, words and actions
 of other people. We have to be very strong and protected
 and that can happen if we practice not getting influenced
 by the energy around us. Right now we are quite vulnerable.
 So everything thats happening around us creates an impact.
 We should take care of ourselves and the people around us,
 if someone is trying to do something, do not create a single
 thought of doubt or negativity. If we create thoughts of
 doubt and fear for the child, we disempower the child. Let
 us create only powerful thoughts, you can do it, we have
 faith in you.' Even if the child does not have the power, he
 will get empowered by the parents and succeed. Today in
 the corporate sector they are saying we motivate our people.
 Motivation will not happen with words. Your subordinate is
 late every day; you motivate him by saying I am sure you
 will do it. But your thinking is 'I know him, he is not going
 to come on time; he will always be like this.
 Thoughts and words are different. So when we say we are
 family and we are friends and we are there for each other, let
 it not be just in words. There should be harmony between
 thoughts and words, and that's the simplest thing to take
 care of in relationships. Let there be no conflict between
 what we are thinking and what we are saying. When there
 is a difference, there is also a conflict in the energy that the
 opposite person receives. Remember, that the thought energy
 travels faster.
 ",SS,6
" Don't you think today's world is like this? We say
 'wow, you are wearing such a nice shirt' Inside we are
 thinking 'he doesn't have taste'
 ",SO,6
" Why did we say 'wow, you are wearing a nice shirt?
 ",SS,6
" A lot of people talk like that. We pick it up from
 everyone around us.
 ",SO,6
" But why do I say to you that your shirt is very nice?
 ",SS,6
" To please people.
 ",SO,6
" To please people. This is extremely important. We are
 saying it to make people happy. Now, happiness is not words
 happiness is energy, it is vibrations, it is feelings. I am sending
 a word out by paying a compliment to your shirt, and I am
 also sending other thoughts saying horrible shirt, horrible
 choice, no taste at all. So what's the total energy that comes
 to you? In fact vibration reaches faster and is much more
 powerful than the words.
 ",SS,6
" He will know that I did not like his shirt.
 ",SO,6
" He won't be able to catch your thoughts. We can't catch
 people's thoughts. The mind needs to be really very silent
 to be able to catch peoples thoughts, but we can catch the
 feelings, the vibrations. That is why sometimes after meeting
 people and having a polite conversation, we still feel, I don't
 think they really meant what they said, they were nice to talk
 to but I don't feel anything nice after they left.' The foundation
 of this relationship is false, so it's no relationship at all. If
 I send this conflicting energy to you, you will doubt
 intentions and then you will always doubt my intention.
 Then there is no trust in this relationship; one word and the
 relationship is over because there was no foundation. So we
 need to ask ourselves what are we doing
 One option is: I don't say that you are wearing a nice shirt
 if I am not convinced that it is nice. If I don't feel it's nice, I
 shouldn't say it's nice; it's integrity. If at all I still want to say
 it's nice, first let 'me understand that its nice, by creating
 a thought: okay I might not like a white shirt but that's just
 my choices your choice is nice for you. Create this thought
 and then say it. I keep working on myself till my thought
 and words are in harmony and then I communicate. That
 is communication
 ",SS,6
" If I say you are wearing something nice and actually
 I do not mean it, what happens to me? What am I doing
 to myself, to my soul, to my personality?
 ",SO,6
" I am cheating myself. I am not honest to myself, what I
 think, I don't do. There is disharmony between my thoughts,
 words and actions; I think something else, I say something
 else; and I do something else. There is disharmony and this
 disharmony will then continue. Again I will think I have to
 do this, but my words and actions will not follow, which will
 reduce my will power. It's going to be damaging for us and
 that is why our will power is low today.
 ",SS,6
" We understood the four types of sanskars, which
 is the fifth type?
 ",SO,6
" The fifth sanskar are the original sanskars. When I
 understand my original sanskar, it is easy to take care of
 the other four. Past birth sanskars not in my control
 sanskars from family - not in my control; sanskars from the
 environment not in my control; will power - in my control
 I can create new sanskars through my will power but even
 will power gets activated when I understand my original
 sanskar, my original nature, and that's the original nature of
 every human soul on this planet. Every being is originally
 pure, affectionate, peaceful, blissful and powerful. Every being
 has this nature and we are looking for it outside because we
 have forgotten that this is my nature. Spirituality shifts our
 belief from I want happiness and peace to the truth that I am
 a peaceful being; I am a blissful being; I am a powerful being.
 And then it becomes natural and the whole perspective
 will change. If I want peace, then I am always seeking outside.
 If I understand, I am peace, then I become a giver. So it ends
 our looking for happiness, asking for love, and we start sharing
 our peace, love and happiness with all. It automatically flows
 from us to the people around us. Like when we are stressed
 we don't have to consciously give it to others, all who come in
 our energy field automatically receive it and are influenced. Similarly by being in our natural state of peace and
 happiness, we don't have to give it, it will naturally radiate and
 be felt by family and friends. Energy is like an infection
 we catch it from the people around us",SS,6
" I have been thinking about the hide-
 and-seek that the mind plays. The moment I try to see
 where it is, it vanishes; when I go to my thoughts in order
 to be aware of them, the thoughts stop, and the moment
 I am somewhere else, they come back to me. Where is
 this mind and what is it? How may one control it in
 day-to-day life? Is it through meditation?
 ",SO,7
" Let me share this story with you that I read a few days
 back, about a disciple who goes to his guru and asks for one
 word so that he can achieve what his guru has achieved. The
 guru says 'awareness'. The disciple writes down the word on a
 piece of paper and leaves, thinking he will do this now. When
 he reaches halfway, he wonders ‘but what am I supposed
 to do?' So he goes back and asks his guru, what does the
 word mean? Guru says ""awareness means awareness. The
 disciple says okay and leaves again. But, after sometime he
 comes back and asks, 'but what does it mean and what am I
 supposed to do? The guru says, 'awareness means awareness - which means do not try and to find a logic behind it. Awareness means just be aware of your thoughts;
 just watch your thoughts. We are aware of everything that is
 happening in the world. We are aware of what is happening
 under the ocean; we are aware of what is happening on the
 moon; we are aware of what is happening on other planets;
 we are aware of what is happening in the neighbour's house;
 we are aware of what is happening everywhere. So, awareness
 means to know what's happening. Now, awareness means just
 to know what's happening...
 ",SS,7
" Within me?
 ",SO,7
" Nothing within. That again is very complicated. When
 you say look within, it's very complicated. Look within, but
 where? Look at what? What are we supposed to do? Look
 within means just look at the thoughts that I create. Take a
 walk early in the morning; its not about just looking at who is
 walking, who is wearing what, who is listening to music, who
 is talking about what, what has happened in the newspaper;
 just talk to yourself. What am I thinking? You can practise
 this the whole day.
 ",SS,7
" People will say this guy is talking to himself and has
 gone mad.
 ",SO,7
" You won't come to know when I am talking to myself. Just
 stop and check - What am I thinking?
 ",SS,7
" But the moment I stop to check what I am thinking,
 that thought stops. Some other thought then takes over me
 away for the next few hours, before I come back to what I
 was thinking
 ",SO,7
" This is because I haven't done it in a very long time. Once
 I do it regularly, I won't need to stop and look at what I am
 thinking. I will always be aware of what I am thinking. Suppose
 today has not been a nice day at work; so I come back and I
 am sitting with the paper. The television is on but my mind
 is working - it's not interested in the running television. I am
 thinking - this shouldn't have happened, this is not the way
 things should have happened today, this is not the way they
 should have spoken to me. I have been working so hard, but
 I just don't get recognised for my work. Who is thinking all
 this? I am thinking. That's all; this is awareness; this is what
 I am thinking. The second stage of awareness is: is this the
 right kind of thinking for me? And third stage of awareness
 is: can I change it? That's all.
 ",SS,7
" What will happen if I am not thinking? I have to think
 something.
 ",SO,7
" Yes, there is never a stage when we are not thinking.
 ",SS,7
" Either some kind of song goes on, or some kind of a
 jingle, or something said by somebody .. it goes on and on;
 the mind is all the time on. And you mean to say one has to
 switch it over to something else, to feed it something else
 ",SO,7
" It's like water, flowing constantly. I can't stop it but I can
 always channelize it; I don't have to flow this side, I can flow
 the other side. So I just change the direction of the water, give
 it a new direction to flow. Similarly, I dont stop thinking. A
 lot of people think meditation means to stop thinking,
 and so will concentrate on a point of light and say 'no thoughts
 - no thoughts - no thoughts. 'I don't have to think' is also a
 thought.
 It can never happen. The mind can never stop thinking
 We are trying to do something that is not natural. That's why I
 say I am feeling very heavy here. There is too much of pressure
 here because I have tried to suppress something. It's not natural
 ",SS,7
" So much pressure to stop thinking that you are going
 to get up tired and disappointed
 ",SO,7
" Exactly. I have not been able to achieve it and then I say
 I tried meditation but couldn't do it. It happens with many
 people. There is so much going on in the mind, it is like a
 car that is in the fifth gear and I suddenly want to bring it
 down to neutral. I am trying to do it in one go. What's going
 to happen? I get a jerk
 ",SS,7
" Shall we go back a little? You said be aware - okay,
 I start being aware. Then what happens? I just honestly want
 to know what happens practically.
 ",SO,7
" Practically, the first thing that happens is knowledge
 ",SS,7
" You said be aware - okay, I start being aware. Then what
 happens? Now I am aware that I am speaking to you. This
 is my thought and my question. So now that I am aware of
 my thought, what next?
 ",SO,7
" First thing is to be aware that I am creating this thought.
 A very common illusion is that the thought is coming to me
 because of some stimulus. You know, a lot of people use this
 language: 'that thought just came to me'. What does it mean?
 ",SS,7
" He reminded me of that, he made me think, he made
 me do. The language is wrong?
 ",SO,7
" Yes! The expression is all wrong because the belief systems
 are confused inside. 'I was just hit by those feelings, by those
 thoughts.' As if something comes from outside.... Thoughts
 don't come to us; feelings don't come from outside. However
 tough the situation may be, I am the creator of the thought
 The minute I understand I am the creator of the thought, the
 blame game is over
 ",SS,7
" So I am aware of my thought. The next step is to know
 that I am the creator of this thought. Then I will analyse
 why waste a thought. It is such a bad thought, it's going to
 hurt me, disturb me. Let me improve on this. Am I right?
 ",SO,7
" Absolutely. I will be able to change the thought once I
 have taken the responsibility that I am the creator.
 ",SS,7
" Responsibility is hard work. I may say I am ready to
 take responsibility but I never really understand it.
 ",SO,7
" Because the focus is so much outside. The attention is always
 outside. We were aware of what is happening outside. Then
 we felt things happening inside. But because we were focused
 on the outside, we were not aware that what was happening
 inside was our creation and we had a choice.
 ",SS,7
" I remember what you told me once. Suppose a child
 hits a table and falls. You say this table is to blame and it
 is a bad thing let's beat this table. The child feels better
 when you say this; he doesn't even understand that it's his
 mistake. So the conditioning of such a thinking begins in
 childhood. This table is in the wrong place.
 ",SO,7
" This is true. I should be made to understand that the table
 is where it is supposed to be; it is I who failed to see the table
 while playing.
 Yes, I have to understand this. Let's say my boss shouted
 at me this morning. I had worked very hard; I was sincere; I
 finished everything on time. But he still shouted at me. My
 mind starts, 'He just doesn't respect sincerity; he doesn't know
 how to appreciate and motivate his people. These thoughts are
 coming to me; it is how I feel. And who is responsible for this?
 It's my boss, and I am justified in thinking like this. Then I say
 my boss needs to change. And there goes the self-awareness
 and the inner responsibility.
 ",SS,7
" So if I am aware first, then I will know that I am creating
 this thought towards my boss and I am also sending out
 negative energy to him. Then, while sending this energy
 to him, I am also creating so much negative energy within
 me. So it is all give-and-take of negative energy and I am
 surrounded with that.
 ",SO,7
" Not only that, the energy that I am creating and sending to
 him is also affecting those around me. My family, with whom
 I am sitting at home in the evening, is feeling that energy too
 because I am creating it. You know, it's like a perfume. Like it
 or not, I do get the smell of the perfume that you use. That's
 why if we are under stress we automatically pass it on to our
 children
 ",SS,7
" This reminds me of something quite interesting. When I am stressed and angry and come home in that state
 of mind, my dog, instead of greeting me, just goes into
 a corner.
 ",SO,7
" Now we will just change the way we think. In the whole
 day we are creating about 40 to 50 thousand thoughts. This
 translates into 25 to 30 thoughts per minute, created without
 awareness. Every time we say this is coming to me. So one
 can imagine what quality of life one is living. It's like you are
 the chairman of a company that has 40,000 to 50,000 products
 coming out of the factory on a daily basis and you are not
 aware of the product quality. Hence, there is chaos.
 Broadly, we can classify thoughts into four types. Pure,
 powerful, positive thoughts are one category. They will be
 absolutely clean and selfless. These attributes are rare today
 Selfless means thinking more about the needs and happiness,
 etc. of other people than about your own, with no expectation
 attached. Wherever there will be an expectation it will be
 followed by hurt, so it's not positive anymore. Negative thoughts
 Resentment, hatred, criticism, anger, and these come in large
 numbers. Necessary thoughts: I have to do this, I have to go
 here, I have to meet so and so. They are neither positive nor
 negative; they are neutral. But let's be careful that the neutral
 does not get followed by the negative. Let's say I have to go to
 the airport: It's a necessary thought. 'I hope there is no traffic
 jam on the way; I hope I will reach in time. So, a neutral
 thought may be followed by negative thoughts. The neutral
 thought will be one but it is followed sometimes by a series of negative thoughts. The fourth type of thought is waste thoughts, 
 things that are not in my control. Thinking about that which
 is not in my control is a waste of time and energy - that is I
 am thinking either about the moment that has passed or about
 a moment that is still to come. Both are not in my control.
 The past and the future are not in my control.
 ",SS,7
" Past, future, or thinking about other people, they are
 a waste.
 ",SO,7
" Even when I am thinking about other people - they should
 have done this, why did they do this, I want them to do this - 
 it's either in the past or in the future. I don't accept them
 in the present moment as they are. If we just practise this for
 one day, if we are just aware about this for one day, we will
 be shocked. At any moment just check what you are thinking.
 You will be thinking either about something that has
 already happened or about something that is still to happen.
 So we are living either in the past or in the future. Both are
 a waste because both are not in my control.
 ",SS,7
" I remember once I was driving home from my shooting
 and was thinking of my scene that I had just rehearsed. I
 was driving alone and thinking. I wish I had done that. As
 the scene kept playing in my mind, I crossed my home. I
 had to take a U-turn and go back.
 ",SO,7
" Actually we can cross our whole life if we are like this,
 thinking about the past or the future. Just be constantly aware
 that first is knowledge that I am the creator of the thought
 and second that there are these different types of thoughts.
 negative and waste thoughts are damaging. Waste thoughts
 are a waste of energy and this waste, in turn, is followed by
 further negative thoughts. The minute I go into the past, the
 thoughts run along these lines: Oh! It should have been like this; 
 it should not have been like that; Those days were better
 they shouldn't have said this. If I go into the future, my thought
 can be: When this happens then I will be happy. This means
 now I am not happy. It's not a nice thought
 ",SS,7
" Now I understand why people say 'I didn't do anything
 today why am I so tired?' If he had gone to play a game of
 golf, he wouldn't have been so tired.
 ",SO,7
" Yes then the mind wouldn't have been creating so many
 negative and waste thoughts, while it was concentrating on
 something else
 Forty to fifty thousand thoughts in a day! If they are not
 of the right quality, what will happen to the system inside? A
 psychiatrist will tell us that, on an average, 80 per cent of the
 time the mind is in the past and 15 per cent of the time it is
 in the future and so 95 per cent is gone as waste
 ",SS,7
" And out of the 80 per cent wonder how much is positive.
 ",SO,7
" There is nothing positive in the past because if it was a
 pleasant past and I am thinking about it, then I am thinking
 that those days were better. So there is nothing positive there.
 People say it is good to have nice memories. Yes, it's a memory
 but it's past. It's over. What is important is now.
 ",SS,7
" How often people speak about the past when you meet
 them. You should have seen the salutes I received when I
 was in the army, when I was a general; I was this; I was that
 ",SO,7
" What you are feeling inside right now is this: those were
 the days when I got all of that from everybody, but today I
 don't have that kind of attention. So, by saying all this about
 my past, I am trying to seek attention from people around me.these are only words. We say very few words compared
 to how much we think. There could be 25 to 30 thoughts per minute 
 but not 25 to 30 sentences in the same time. One may not be using even 4 to 5 sentences in a minute. Every thought
 has an effect on the entire system, on every cell of the body
 Thoughts are the most powerful source of energy that we have,
 so let's be careful about how we use them. It's like you possess
 nuclear energy - you can use it for healing and you can use it
 to destroy the world. The energy is the same. You have your
 MRI, CT scan, etc., done with nuclear energy on one hand,
 and you also have all the nuclear missiles on the other hand.
 They are the same energy. Every form of energy can be used
 for constructive as well as destructive purpose. It's the same
 with thought energy. It can give and create love, peace, purity; it can give and create hatred, resentment, worry, anxiety. It's 
 the same thought energy but the wonderful part is that these
 are my thoughts, so I have a choice.
 ",SS,7
" I am still thinking about what you said just now about
 every thought having an effect on my body. If I am going
 to think thousands and thousands of thoughts in a day and
 millions of thoughts in a month or my lifetime, what will
 happen to my body?
 ",SO,7
" See, mostly for an illness the doctors will tell us it's
 psychosomatic, that is the connection of the mind and the
 body. So heal the mind, the body will follow. Of course
 you must take care of the body, but it will not be of much use if
 we take care only of the body and don't heal the mind. That's
 why someone will say I am a strict vegetarian; I don't smoke;
 I dont drink; I exercise every day, and yet I had a heart attack
 in my 30s or 40s. That's because I took care only of the body,
 while the mind was under stress",SS,7
" We have been speaking about awareness,
 thought and mind. After practicing it, I started speaking softly
 (I usually speak loudly) and my hand movements were not
 jerky. Everything felt peaceful, light and stable.
 ",SO,8
" That goes to prove that if you take care of the mind,
 everything else is taken care of. It is the mind that has an
 effect on the body. It is the mind that creates the words and it
 is the mind that finally comes out into actions. When we are
 talking about transformation I want to change this habit, I
 want to change this part of my personality; I want to change
 this particular behaviour - we always try to bring about the
 transformation outside. The way I walk, the way I talk, the
 way I speak to people, the way I behave.. we tell others
 also to behave like this or that. This transformation is always
 temperary because the seed is the thought. Not changing the
 thought it self will have a temporary effect; the change will last
 for a few days and then we are back to the old self. However
 if I change the thought, I won't even be aware but suddenly I 
 will find so much transformation outside
 ",SS,8
" So we won't need to work on each and every aspect of
 our body, our movement, our speech, the way we look, the
 way we talk. It is just like what an actor does in method
 acting. Method acting teaches us to go from within to the
 outside. Once I start believing that I am so and so, then
 I don't have to check on my walk, on the way I speak, it
 happens naturally once I believe in it.
 ",SO,8
" I am creating the character inside; the whole sketch is there
 inside. Who does this inner work? The mind does.
 ",SS,8
" When you believe in it, then things follow. You are not
 acting anymore; you are living, you are playing.
 ",SO,8
" You are naturally flowing. Similarly, I am a peaceful being.
 I have created the character inside, so now I don't have to take
 care of how to speak, how to walk, how to behave. Once I 
 am convinced inside that I the actor - am a peaceful being,
 then everything that the actor will do will be through the
 vibration of peace.
 ",SS,8
" So that means I should play the role of a peaceful
 personality. Think about myself as a peaceful being, happy being...
 ",SO,8
" You have to come back to the root first. I the peaceful being
 has this name, this body and plays this role. Whether its
 an actor, a doctor, a lawyer, it doesn't matter what the role is.
 ",SS,8
" So the peaceful being doesn't have to learn each
 every step since he is peaceful.
 ",SO,8
" Each one of us is an actor and playing so many roles. In
 your lifetime....
 In your lifetime, let's say you played three hundred roles
 but every role had that stamp of you as the actor - only you
 played it in that way. Even if another actor copies you and
 plays the same roles, he will be different from you because he
 has his own style. So the actor's personality will always reflect
 in every role he plays. So now I have to remember, who am
 I the actor and what are the roles I play? So whichever role
 I play - a father, a husband, a friend, a boss the actor's
 personality has to show in every role. Now who am I the actor?
 I am a pure, peaceful, love-full being. And it doesn't matter
 whether I am talking to a friend or whether I am talking to
 my son, the peaceful personality will be there in both. The
 reason I am different with different people is that here I am
 a friend, and there I am a father.
 ",SS,8
" I have to play a father here, so I will order my child.
 ",SO,8
" So I am more conscious of the role rather than the actor
 who is playing the role. Old belief systems tell me that a father
 should be like this. So I am behaving according to some set
 patterns of how a father should be. A father should always be
 authoritative, controlling and strict.
 ",SS,8
" If I am different with one person, speak differently to
 the other person, it means I am behaving in contrast to my
 character? There is no consistency?
 ",SO,8
" I am only role-conscious. I am a friend of this person, so
 I should speak like this. Here I am the boss, so this is the way
 to behave with my juniors. The actor inside is just not aware.
 ",SS,8
" But everybody behaves differently at
 different places and times. One is different in office, at home,
 with wife, with friends, and so on.
 ",SO,8
" Which one of these is our original nature?
 ",SS,8
" I don't know which one is original. I am confused. There
 are so many different roles.

" Let's take a simple example. We walk into an office and
 within 10 minutes we meet four people: one from the security,
 one at the reception, then someone in middle management, and
 finally the top chairman. Four people in 10 minutes, and four
 times our behaviour changes. My way of talking to the security
 guard and my way of talking to the chairman are different.
 Out of these four which one is my original personality?
 ",SS,8
" I am confused. I am playing different roles all the time.
 I don't have a consistent role.
 ",SO,8
" My original personality is not there because I am changing
 every time. I talked to a security guard, I talked to a receptionist,
 and accordingly I changed. Next I talked to a manager and so I changed; then I talked to a chairman, and again I changed.
 I'm connecting to positions, to status, to physical looks, to all
 the things that are acquired
 ",SS,8
" But if I ask this question to anybody, they will say what
 is wrong in doing that. So isn't it normal, since everybody
 does it?
 ",SO,8
" We don't know if it's normal, but yes, we have been doing it
 for a very long time. We are talking and connecting to people
 on the basis of everything that's acquired. Today you are the
 chairman, tomorrow you are not, so tomorrow my relationship
 with you will change. In that case, that was not a relationship
 at all. And that's why relationships are so fragile. I can change
 the minute anything that you have acquired has changed. We
 are forgetting who we are. This acquired self is the ego; acquired
 by knowledge, by position, by wealth, by property. Everything
 that I have acquired, it's not me, it belongs to me. But when
 I am in the consciousness of this is what I have acquired
 and this is what you have acquired, it is the acquired who
 are talking to each other. And that's why there isn't a strong
 foundation; it's the ego of one talking to the ego of the other.
 When egos are talking, it is a position talking to a position,
 a bank balance talking to another bank balance. What about
 the pure being talking to another pure being?
 This is where we really need to stop and realize that we
 are always connecting only to the outside, while the actor is
 sleeping inside. Even if I find that the actors around me are
 sleeping and I wake up, the others will wake up gradually
 When you are doing theatre, what do you do when one actor
 forgets his lines?
 ",SS,8
" I either use his line or give him a cue, or try to help
 out or improvise it so that the act goes on.
 ",SO,8
" But for you to be able to do that, what do you have to
 concentrate on first? Suppose I am the actor and I forget my
 script. For you to help me with my part, you will have to first
 pay attention to your script, right? You have two options. One,you pay attention to your script and just flow in the right way
 so that I will get the cue and I will also start flowing in the
 right direction. Two, you get affected by the fact that I have
 forgotten my script, because of which your attention deviates
 from your script and you are more interested in telling me
 how I should be speaking, what I should be speaking.
 Now, in the whole day, check how much are we concentrating
 on other peoples script what they should be doing, what
 they should be saying, how they should be behaving. In the
 process we are not aware of our own script, what I should
 be thinking, what I should be saying. Throughout the day, how
 many times are we writing other people's script? We actually
 sit in front of the television writing the script for the prime
 minister, for the cricketer, for the film actor; they shouldn't
 be acting like this, they shouldn't be wearing this, this is not
 how they should have done this. We are just wasting time and
 energy by trying and writing their script. Lets write only one
 script - our script, because that is the only one that will be
 followed. I can keep on writing your script how you should
 be, how you should talk, how you should perform, how you
 should behave. Are you going to go according to my script?
 What a waste of time and energy! I am sitting and writing
 the scripts of so many actors and none of them are going to
 use my script.
 ",SS,8
" I find it so silly that I am doing something that is of
 no use and wasting time.
 ",SO,8
" At a time you can write only one script; if I am writing
 yours, I am definitely not writing mine. Look at it this way
 You start saying something to me which I do not like; you start
 shouting at me. Now, instead of taking care of how I should
 be, I'm telling you this is not how you should be talking to me.
 While I am trying to change your script I go out of control,
 and soon I forget my own script and I am shouting louder
 than you did. When I start to write your script and forget my
 own lines, what will happen to the play?
 ",SS,8
" Disaster.
 ",SO,8
" That's what's happening everywhere around. If we just
 start focusing on our script, everyone else will take their cue
 Someone next to you is getting angry, has lost his temper,
 is going out of control, but if you remain in control he will
 soon come back into control because you have retained your
 composure. You are writing your script and they will come back
 to their original quality of peace. The other possibility is that
 soon everyone will forget their script and go out of control.
 This is a choice we need to make that of writing our own
 script, because that's the only one that will be followed in any
 case. The others will go into the category of waste thoughts.
 So let's be aware of this, because this is awareness. I am aware
 of how many times in the day I just keep thinking about what
 other people should be doing and saying.
 ",SS,8
" But why can't I just stop myself and ask what is the
 point, why am I wasting time?
 ",SO,8
" Now we will do it because we are aware; earlier we were
 not aware, so we thought it was natural to think like that.
 Its like you see a tap running and you immediately close it
 because water is getting wasted.
 ",SS,8
" Our energy depletes, right?
 ",SO,8
" It depletes because we are thinking of something that is
 not in our control.
 ",SS,8
" This reminds me of something interesting you said, 'For
 each and every thought we have, there is some reaction in
 the body'.
 ",SO,8
" The health of our body reflects the quality of our thoughts.
 ",SS,8
" Many things are clear to me now. Earlier I thought, what
 is this, how is it possible, how can I not be angry when this
 happens? It's so natural to be angry. I remember the time
 when I didn't have money and I could not sleep all night
 because someone who owed me money cheated on me. It
 was so painful and I used to beat him up in my thoughts.
 I ended up with high blood pressure.
 ",SO,8
" In this particular situation, someone has cheated you of
 money. There's no denying that it's a grave situation and it's
 natural for you to be upset and angry, but let us keep our loss
 up till there. I have lost money but this is not in my control;
 somebody else is responsible for the lost money. But what I
 lose, is my peace of mind, health of my body, harmony in my
 relationships, so there I am the reason.
 Then I can say that he cheated me; it's because of him
 I lost the money. But for anything else that I lose, I am the
 reason, I am the cheater. This is what I do to myself
 ",SS,8
" I am being irresponsible. I thought it was natural.
 ",SO,8
" Just remember one thing: what I think I am doing to
 others, I am actually doing it to myself. If I am giving a
 cold shoulder to the other person, talking angrily to the
 other person, it is actually a cold shoulder to me, it's anger
 towards me, because whatever I am creating is first getting
 created in my mind. This means I am the first one who
 experiences it. The cold shoulder that I give you might not
 affect you at all, but since I created the thought, I am bound
 to get affected. So when you are doing something for other
 people, good or bad, just remember that it's less for them
 and more for yourself.
 ",SS,8
" A healthy thought, a healthy body, a healthy life.
 ",SO,8
" Nurture my pure thoughts, loving thoughts, forgiving
 thoughts. Somebody has done something wrong, but I just
 forgive and forget. I am not forgiving him I am forgiving
 myself. If I keep holding on to the resentment and the hatred,
 it's not for the other person, its here and it's in me. I am going
 to be creating it and I am going to be experiencing it. So, the
 entire responsibility comes back to me.
 ",SS,8
" The other day I met someone who told me
 about the time when somebody cheated him of fifty thousand
 rupees. It was a big amount for him. And you know what
 his reaction was? He said, 'May God give him so much that
 he does not repeat this act with anybody else; he must be in
 need of money; may God give him ten times more so that
 some other person is not cheated like I have been. After
 about eight years, the man who cheated came back with
 the money.
 ",SO,8
" Your acquaintance sent him good vibrations, good wishes, pure energy. The person came and returned him the money
 after eight years; the question is what was the quality of the
 mind for those eight years? Your acquaintance created this
 thought that maybe the other person who took the money
 needed it badly and was needy; he even blessed the person
 saying that may he have much more; in other words he was
 at peace. The other option for him was to harbour hatred,
 resentment and revenge for eight years. He would still get back
 the money after eight years, but in those years he would have
 done so much damage to himself that the money would not
 be able to repair i",SS,8
" We were speaking about thoughts and
 awareness. I realise that by the time I am aware of something,
 the action has already taken place. Thoughts come and go so
 fast that it is slightly difficult to be aware or be in control of
 them; yes, one thing has happened that when I am getting
 angry, I can stop in the middle of things. I am waiting for
 the awareness to happen before the anger triggers.
 ",SO,9
" You know this is a very good start, to be at least aware.
 You are able to stop there in the middle, which means if earlier
 you were going to stay out of control for 10 minutes, now you
 will be able to probably finish in a minute or so.
 ",SS,9
" Something within me reminds me, talks to me, to take
 control of myself.
 ",SO,9
" Because we have changed our definition of what is natural.
 Earlier we said anger was natural; so we gave ourselves the
 liberty to get angry. Anger was needed to get work done. That
 was our belief system. Our anger was justified so we did not
 find the need to change. Now we are experimenting with a
 new belief system. Peace is natural and we want peace; and
 now we understand that it is our own sanskar. Now when you
 get angry, you understand that you are doing something that
 is not your natural self, and you realize and stop
 ",SS,9
" We left at a question in the last chapter. What would
 people say -look, he is a weak man, the other person said
 so and so to him in public but he kept quiet.
 ",SO,9
" First, lets see what is more important: how I feel or what
 people feel. This is a very big question. We need to check
 carefully, it will be different for each of us. For some their
 own personal well-being is more important and for some,
 other peoples opinion matters more.
 ",SS,9
" I will say both, but honestly mine is more important.
 ",SO,9
" Let's visualise a scene, two colleagues in an office. One
 of them is screaming and hurling abuses at the other one
 The opposite person reacts in the same manner and shouts
 even louder. Would we call this strength? Now in the same
 situation, the second person remains calm and stable, 
 understanding that it is not the right time to explain his
 perspective. Not only does he remain composed outwardly
 but even empathizes with his colleague and retains his good
 wishes for him. If you are a spectator to this scene, would
 you call this weakness? Let's not even think whether it is
 strength or weakness, let's just see which behaviour is more
 sensible and easier. If someone shouts at us, is it easier to
 shout back or to remain internally stable and retain my right thoughts and feelings for the opposite person who has just
 shouted at me?
 ",SS,9
" The second option is very, very difficult.
 ",SO,9
" So that's where strength comes in.
 ",SS,9
" And you think doing something difficult is strength.
 ",SO,9
" Yes, because it requires strength to do something difficult.
 I have to pick up this whole chair, it requires strength. I say
 I can't do it; it's my physical weakness. To do something
 against the tide, of negative energy, to remain protected first
 and then create positive energy against the tide of negative
 energy requires a tremendous amount of strength. To shout
 back and say he shouted at me first, what kind of strength
 does that require?
 ",SS,9
" In school we used to get bullied. If we kept quiet, we
 would be called a sissy. You are not a man, people would say.
 ",SO,9
" When we are bullied, we are quiet but internally we are
 disturbed. If the boss shouts at me, I can't say anything back
 because of his position. But internally I am not stable; it starts
 having an impact on me. People will say that I may as well
 shout back and finish it off, it's better to get angry rather than
 keep my anger inside. Here we are not talking about keeping
 our anger inside; we are simply not creating that turbulent
 energy; that is strength.
 ",SS,9
" It's so difficult these days to say a word
 to your boss. Everyone wants to retain their position. People
 hear so much from bosses, but internally they are in pain.
 ",SO,9
" So they are already creating anger. It's a silent anger, its
 internal. Anger is anger, whether it is in the form of hurt, in
 the form of hatred, or in the form of verbal abuse. It's having
 an effect on you. But once I start taking care of my thoughts
 and feelings, I will be able to stop outside first and gradually
 will stop creating it inside. Then it will not matter whether its
 my boss or my child; the rule remains the same.
 ",SS,9
" So, to experience unlimited happiness what should one
 do? How does one acquire this kind of mental stability?
 ",SO,9
" First, understand that anger is not strength; it's absolute
 weakness because in those moments I have gone out of control,
 and going out of control is not strength.
 ",SS,9
" If anger is not strength, what is anger? Is it a void? Is
 it frustration or an inferiority complex?
 ",SO,9
" Anger is the whole turbulence that takes place inside; I
 justify it and I blame the world for what I am feeling, and I
 want to get back at them. The anger could be because of one
 person and it might come out on another one. We give vent
 to our anger in various ways and towards various people. You
 say I can't say anything to the boss; so when I come home I
 shout at my wife. My wife can't say anything to me, so she
 goes and shouts at the child. So I can't say that I didn't get
 angry at all; it's just that I accumulated it inside at the moment
 when things were heated. I didn't vent it but then I created
 it, and eventually took it out on someone or the other. Let's
 understand this mechanism. Probably then, I will be paying
 a little more attention to what I am doing in my life. Every
 time I create a thought, what's the next thing that happens?
 ",SS,9
" After the thought will be the action.
 ",SO,9
" That's a later stage. What happens just after I create the
 thought?
 ",SS,9
" When I create a thought, I am creating certain emotions
 within me.
 ",SO,9
" Yes. Immediately after I create a thought, the next
 thing that happens is the feeling. Sometimes we are not
 aware of our thoughts but we are aware of our feelings. I
 am not feeling very nice today; I am not sure which is the
 thought that I created but I am aware that I am not feeling
 nice today. Or I am feeling very nice today; whatever I am
 feeling, it's because of some thoughts that I created. So, if I
 am not aware of my thoughts, let me just be aware of how
 I am feeling today because the feeling is only a result of the
 thought. I have to meet you.. this is a thought that I will
 create. Based on my past experiences or what I have heard
 about you, it will immediately generate a feeling. Thought is
 always followed by a feeling.
 All my feelings put together about you, about the world,
 help me develop my attitude. A thought about you is followed
 by a feeling subsequently; and because this has happened many
 times, an attitude towards you is also created. You know, when
 we talk about 'changing our attitude', it is about changing the
 thought. How can I change my atitude? I have to first change
 the thoughts that I created.
 We cannot change our attitude. We have to change the
 thoughts, and our attitude will automatically change.
 ",SS,9
" And to change the thought?
 ",SO,9
" That's what we have been talking about - sit back, check,
 choose and change.
 ",SS,9
" Awareness and practice. And awareness itself is practice.
 Being aware, being aware, being aware all the time, that's
 the practice.
 ",SO,9
" And gradually you will find that your atitude has changed.
 ",SS,9
" You won't have to think of anything because then it is
 automatic.
 ",SO,9
" It is in the process plant.
 ",SS,9
" So the base is the awareness of your thoughts.
 ",SO,9
" There is a stage before that which we will see, but let's
 consider the subsequent stages first... thought, feeling, attitude,
 and action. If I have a positive attitude towards you, my way
 of talking, my way of behaving and what I do with you will
 be different, but if I have a negative attitude, everything will
 be different.
 ",SS,9
" When you said action, do you know what you remind
 me of? My director calling out 'action' and I starting to do
 my scene! He says 'cut' and I stop.
 ",SO,9
" This is something we can do throughout the day - action
 and then cut. In your profession at least you have a retake,
 but in normal life we don't have a retake. The action is already
 done. When shooting, despite the retake option you pay so
 much attention. In life, where there is no retake, we hardly
 pay attention. Every thought that I create has an impact on
 me and my body and the people around me. For 10 minutes
 I have created thoughts of pain, and in the 11th minute I say
 okay, enough now, let me change but those ten minutes. That's
 why there is this need for constant awareness. It happens with
 practice. The 10 minutes will become 8 and 5 and 3, and then
 finally it will be 'okay, this is it'. And then we will reach a stage
 where we will not be creating it; we will be aware of it as soon
 as we are about to create it and we will say 'okay, change'.
 ",SS,9
" And one day it won't get created at all.
 ",SO,9
" Yes, because then I have come into the consciousness of my
 original self that of a pure being. We are now in the transition
 stage. It's like we are sleeping and trying to wake up. We wake
 up a first and say 'okay, let me sleep for five more minutes
 We wake up to the truth and say I am a peaceful being; and
 then we create anger once more, that is we fall asleep again.
 ",SS,9
" One has to believe first. If I tell somebody tomorrow
 that you are a peaceful being, he will ask me what the proof
 is. Is it because everyone yearns for peace?
 ",SO,9
" You only yearn for that which you are. The body is made of
 five elements of nature: water, air, ether, fire and earth. Whenever
 there is lack of one element in the body, we immediately say
 I want water' 'I want fresh air. Why do I want fresh air? Why
 do I want water? Because the body is made of this and its
 lacking these right now. At that time if you give me anything
 else, I will say no. Similarly, I the being am made up of seven
 elements: purity, peace, power, love, knowledge truth and bliss.
 Every time there is a little imbalance, we say: I want peace, I
 want happiness, I want love, I want power.
 The method may be different but everyone is looking for
 the same things because those are what each one of us is made
 of. I can be using anger as a tool but I am never comfortable
 when I am angry. Anger is not my nature; anger is an acquired
 sanskar, an acquired personality trait.
 ",SS,9
" Probably that is why we like a peaceful person, a peaceful
 being. We like to sit with a saint, and feel at peace in a
 particular temple or shrine, or under a tree.
 ",SO,9
" Because we have come closer to our natural self. We go
 to a scenic place to see the sunrise or the sunset, to feel nice
 Stuck in the middle of a traffic jam, we don't feel nice. Why?
 Chaos is not our natural self. A place or person or a situation
 that makes us feel closer to what we actually are, makes us
 feel nice as well.
 ",SS,9
" So all these seven elements are me and this is the proof
 that whenever I am at peace I am happy. How does one get
 the battery recharged for all these seven elements?
 ",SO,9
" Try to understand the process completely. Now I am
 changing my thought from 'I want peace' to 'I am peace'.
 Thought changes, feeling will change, attitude will change.
 and action will change. Now my actions will not be focussed
 on seeking peace, because now I know that I am peace. My
 actions will be coming from my discovered nature of peace.
 Any action repeated a number of times becomes a habit.
 All my habits put together make up my overall personality. So
 who I am today, the personality is a package of every thought
 we create. Personality development programmes teach us to
 talk like this, smile like this, say hello like this and so on,
 but they will not work if we are not happy inside. How can
 I keep smiling if I am not happy? And even if I am smiling,
 what energy am I sending out? So, personality begins in the
 mind. So it is thought - feeling - attitude - action - habit -
 personality. Now, we come to the last and most important step.
 This personality goes out into the world, working, socializing
 and being with family; at every step I am creating my destiny.
 And it started from my thoughts.
 ",SS,9
" Oh! So thought is creating destiny? And life is a
 manifestation of one's thoughts? I am creating my future, I
 am creating my life, and I am creating my environment. I
 am getting back what I am giving. Today it all starts from
 a thought and it envelops our life, our future, our destiny.
 ",SO,9
" And then we would do anything to change our destiny
 today. We can go to an astrologer, to a numerologist, to a tarot
 card reader. We want them to predict our destiny, and if it's
 not what we like, then we ask them to do something to change
 our destiny. The truth, though, is no one can do anything.
 ",SS,9
" How can we change our thinking?
 ",SO,9
" First step is to understand how important it is. Earlier we
 would say that they did this to me so I have to get back at
 them. But now we take care that what we think and do will
 create our destiny. We are so confused today about destiny;
 we say this happened to me; it's my fate, my luck. But fate
 decided by who? Since we don't know who it is, we just point
 the blame somewhere up there and say God decided this for
 me, again putting the responsibility on someone else because
 we are not ready to take the responsibility. The fact is I am
 creating my destiny. The energy that I send out is my 'karma'
 and the same energy when it comes back in the form of
 situations or people is destiny. When we go to an astrologer
 and he tells us to wear a particular ring because things will
 be much better then, we obey and wear the ring. When we
 wear the ring we create a thought naturally that now things
 will be better for us, and things are actually fine because we
 use the ring as a stimulus to change our thoughts, and thereby
 change our destiny.
 ",SS,9
" So it comes to having faith in that ring.
 ",SO,9
" Yes. If I wear the ring without faith, it will not work.
 ",SS,9
" A holy person tells us that he will write this particular
 prayer, put it in a taweez and you wear it around your neck,
 then no black magic or any evil is going to afflict you. We
 are so sure that nothing will happen to us now. So our
 thought has changed.
 ",SO,9
" For how long are you able to create that thought after
 wearing it? If we are not aware, this thought will be there
 for a few days; after that the ring or taweez is just a part of
 the body.
 ",SS,9
" I never thought of this point. Now somebody gave me
 this ring and I am wearing it; for a few days I am aware. I
 think if I wear this, all my negativities will be gone and I
 will be a happy person. I forget it after sometime and go
 to my actual nature. I haven't changed myself at the core.
 ",SO,9
" You used the ring as a stimulant to change your thought.
 Until you are aware of the ring, you are creating the right thought and the belief that 'now everything will be okay, no
 one can do anything wrong to me'. This was the thought that
 was required, with or without the ring. But because you are
 wearing the ring, faith in the ring makes it easier to create
 these thoughts. One month down the line it's a part of your
 body and again you will go back to your same old thought
 process - 'they did this to me, they did that to me'. When
 you forget that you are wearing the ring, then the effect will
 not be there.
 ",SS,9
" So stimulus is creating the thought
 ",SO,9
" Stimulus is not creating the thought; I am using the stimulus
 to create the thought.
 ",SS,9
" I am creating my own thought because of the stimulus.
 So you want us to do the same thing without this ring?
 ",SO,9
" You are doing it, the ring is not",SS,9
" You have said life is a manifestation of
 one's thoughts. You also mentioned astrologers and people
 who predict your life or give you a ring or an amulet to wear.
 ",SO,10
" We need to understand it in the right perspective. Everything
 that is guiding us in how to lead our lives or is predicting our
 future - whether it's astrology, numerology, or some other
 branch - is a science. People have studied that science over
 a period of time and have acquired a sound understanding
 for it. It's like a doctor who has studied the body. Let's say I
 consult a doctor with my blood tests and he says there is a
 probability that in the future I am at risk of getting diabetes. It's
 an assessment based on my genetic factors, my current lifestyle
 and on the present condition of my health. I go back home
 with the new information. There are two ways of responding.
 One, 'I am going to have diabetes; it's going to happen because
 my mother has it, my grandmother has it; I have so much
 stress and my lifestyle is very erratic. The doctor also says that
 I am going to have diabetes. So if the doctor said that I can
 get it in a year most likely if don't take the right measures
 then with such a negative attitude, it is possible that I will get
 it within six months. The stress that I create with the doctor's
 information will precipitate the disease. Ultimately, I will say
 that what the doctor said has turned out to be right.
 The other option I have after I receive this information
 is to take complete charge of myself. I bring about a shift in
 my lifestyle, I start meditating, I start 'pranayam' and yoga. I
 change my food habits and sleep timings. I start walking. I
 take care of my emotions and then continue leading a holistic
 lifestyle. There is a great chance that I will never have diabetes
 and the assessment will not come true.
 It's a response to an assessment acting like a prediction. The
 probability was there, so that was pure science. There was a
 probability of my getting diabetes, but it was still a probability;
 not a reality. I picked up that probability as a warning signal
 and brought about a shift in my lifestyle. The assessment was
 then not true because I took charge. But if I dont take charge
 and I just accept the probability as a reality, then it is going to
 become the reality. I have accepted it already, I have created
 anxiety and worry, and so it is going to happen because the
 probability was already there.
 In the same way, I go to an astrologer. He says based on
 the planets, the moon, the stars, the positions right now, there
 is a probability that this and this and this will happen in the
 next six months or the next two years. There is a probability
 of your physical health getting affected, of your business facing
 some obstacles, of someone trying to harm you. It's only a
 probability; it's not a reality yet. This is very important to
 understand, that it's a probability predicted by someone who
 understands the science. So we thank them for making this
 prediction and giving us the probability, but now we take charge.
 ",SS,10
" So you mean to say we should take it as a warning and
 then like we did for diabetes, modify our lifestyle, and see to
 it that the prediction or the probability doesn't come true.
 ",SO,10
" Yes, but only if we have the power to listen to the information
 and not get influenced by it. What happens unfortunately is
 that when somebody gives us the prediction, we accept it as
 reality. We say this is going to happen because the expert
 has said this, and the expert's predictions for so many people
 have come true. It's going to come true in my case as well.
 We have already converted the probability into a reality. Our
 mind accepts it that this is going to happen. Thoughts create
 destiny and so it happens.
 ",SS,10
" Earlier the expert's predictions might have come true
 many times. So that may be a reason for us to believe in him.
 ",SO,10
" True, because its pure science and there is nothing wrong
 about the prediction. It's a probability for the one for whom
 that prediction was made; that person accepted the prediction
 as reality. His mind accepted it, so it manifested as reality
 ",SS,10
" But don't you think that knowing the prediction will
 change the destiny?
 ",SO,10
" There are two ways. Let's say someone predicts for me
 my next six months are going to be very challenging; the
 planetary movements are not favourable. Whatever I do, I am
 not going to be successful. It's a prediction. If I don't know this
 prediction, I don't know this piece of information. So I put in
 all my efforts, obstacles come but I overcome them, because
 I am all motivated to work. I want success and I am working
 for success. Obstacles come but I don't get demotivated. The
 other option is I know the prediction that success is difficult
 to achieve in the next six months because planet movements
 are not favourable for me. The information is so powerful for
 me that I am not able to raise my thoughts beyond it. I start
 my business but I say 'what's the use, I know its not going to
 be successful in these six months. Whatever I do there is
 going to be a problem. Even when I am faced with the smallest
 obstacles, I say that this was going to happen, and I lose my
 enthusiasm needed to overcome the obstacle.
 ",SS,10
" So, it is safer not to have this piece of information.
 ",SO,10
" Either you don't take the prediction, or if you know the
 prediction then raise your thoughts beyond it, and go above
 that prediction. Take it as a challenge.
 ",SS,10
" I am peace; I am bliss; I am knowledge; I am powerful.
 ",SO,10
" Absolutely. Now where is the obstacle? The obstacle can
 be only something outside. The only thing that is required to
 face an obstacle is stability inside.
 ",SS,10
" Even a child falls so many times before he learns how
 to walk.
 ",SO,10
" The important thing is that when he falls, he gets up and
 starts walking again. Now let's suppose somebody has predicted
 that you are not going to get up for the next six months, try
 walking how ever much you want, you are only going to fall.
 The first time you fall, you say 'forget it, I will try after six
 months because so-and-so has told me that these six months
 I cannot walk' So you don't even try with the right energy
 and because you don't create the right thoughts, you don't get
 the right destiny.
 On hearing the prediction we ask them for a solution, so
 that we can be successful in these six months. Then we are
 told wear this particular colour, wear this particular stone.
 What happens? Do the planets change? No, they are still there.
 But we are doing something that is helping us to change our
 thoughts. First we had the information that these six months
 would not go right for us, and so we were demotivated. Now
 we have the information that if we wear this particular stone,
 success is certain. We create the thought that I am wearing
 the stone and now let any obstacle come, I am going to cross
 it. I will get through the phase while I wear this stone.
 ",SS,10
" People talk about the rays of the Sun passing through
 the stone and going inside the skin. What about that?
 ",SO,10
" I, the being, is energy. I have vibrations. As will be the
 qualities of the being, love, peace, purity, so will be the aura
 of the person. The photographs of deities always feature a
 white light around the head; it's a symbol of the purity of
 the soul. So if the soul is pure, the aura is white. If there is
 some conflict somewhere, the aura is not going to be white
 or cream or yellow - it could be red, blue, or grey. By using
 an outside stimulus, we try to change the colour of the aura,
 which then will have an effect on the mind. So we are going
 from outside to inside. ""The easiest way will be to change my
 thought; automatically the aura will change, vibrations will
 change, situation will change.
 ",SS,10
" Basically the colours and stones are changing our aura?
 ",SO,10
" Yes, these too work, but how much, to what extent and
 for how much time? Someone tells you to wear a red colour
 shirt and things will be better; how often can one wear a red
 colour shirt? Why not just create powerful thoughts instead?
 We always thought that the easiest method was to change
 something outside so as to experience a change inside; its
 actually about changing something inside to experience results
 outside. The process is inside out, not outside in. The inside
 is in my control and is a permanent change.
 ",SS,10
" When you do it from outside, you do not have complete
 control. People who predict something are not entirely right.
 It happens often that you will call them and say that you
 said this to me but it didn't happen, he will probably say,
 ""Sir, I am also a human being and cannot always be correct"".
 ",SO,10
" They were not predicting reality; they were predicting
 a probability. We have to remember this. We have no right
 to say anything to them. A probability will always have a
 percentage. They may even predict that your next six months
 will be very nice, but if you are demotivated inside, nothing is
 going to be smooth. So the prediction is going to be wrong.
 We have been discussing about the effect of external
 influences on our mind. We are practicing to enable our mind
 to go beyond the influence of situations, objects and people. If 
 my mind can go beyond the influence of situations and people,
 then we can also go beyond the influence of planets. Planets
 are also an external influence. They do have an influence, but
 it is up to us whether to get overpowered by it, or to rise
 above the influence. When we are weak internally, everything
 will have an influence; someones smallest word will disturb me 
 because I am weak. The mind doesn't have the power to
 cope with, accommodate and pack up all the thoughts, so
 your one word can upset me for the next one day or for the
 next six months. If your one word can upset me for the next
 six months, the planets' movement can also upset me for the
 next six months. It is all about rising above external influences.
 ",SS,10

 or not.

 would have forgotten that they changed the direction of their
 house. North, south, east, west, these are energies, magnetic
 fields. It is a field and it will have its effect, but the highest field
 is here (in the mind). If we say that we can get along with each
 other come what may - north, east, south, west and then
 we actually can get along. We can then get along even in the
 wrong direction of the house. And if we cannot get along, then
 we cannot do so even in the best designed house. It's about
 the mind ready to take the challenge. We cannot always keep
 changing everything outside; okay, I can change the house.

 is a science, an energy that is much higher than the energy

 thoughts? Earlier I used to get disappointed that I took
 my family for a holiday to make them happy, but my child

" Be happy and then go for the holiday. Not go for the
 holiday to be happy.
 Because I am not going on the holiday for happiness; I am
 going just for fun, for a change from the daily routine. That's
 all that a holiday is. So the holiday will not be for pursuing
 happiness; it will be for expressing and sharing the happiness
 that we are filled with. The perspective changes from taking
 to giving, so then we look forward to meeting people, we look
 lorward to being with everybody, so that we can radiate our
 happiness to them, not so that they can make us happy.
 I am a peaceful and happy being, but I get to experience it
 and express it only when I am in interaction with someone. If
 I am sitting by myself, I don't get to express or experience my
 own qualities, and that's why relationships are so important,
 Unless I am in interaction, unless I have this exchange of
 energy, I will not be expressing and experiencing. I experience
 my quality only when it comes out. When I give anger to
 you, first I experience it; similarly, when I give peace to you,
 first I experience it. I get to experience it only when I am in
 interaction with someone and so I look forward to going to
 work; I look forward to meeting families and friends - not
 for wanting but for expressing and experiencing, and therefore
 sharing.

 or happiness? Can you be at peace if you are not happy? Do
 you get happiness from external factors or from within? The
 mind is fickle like a fast galloping horse and the only way
 to control it is by involving it in good actions beneficial for
 all' I need your help to understand this.
 ",SO,11
" ""The quotation says - ""When you are at peace, you will be
 happy depending on what your idea of happiness is, whether
 you get it from outside or from inside.' Let us stop and check
 what outer happiness is. It's not outer happiness - it's an outer
 stimulus which I use to create happiness for myself.
 ",SS,11
" I like the way you say, 'I create happiness'; emphasis
 always on our creation, you never say, 'it gives me happiness'
 ",SO,11
" At every step, when you are happy, when you are hurt
 when you are upset, just stop and ask who is creating it.
 I am creating it, irrespective of whatever the situation or the stimulus. The more we are aware we will understand that we
 have lived all our life saying you are responsible, whereas all the
 time it was we who were creating it. So that is the awakening
 Now we only need to take care of how can I change what I 
 am creating?
 Without this understanding, we would feel powerless because
 we believe people are responsible for our happiness and people
 are responsible for hurting us. We would wait for people to
 talk nicely to us. At the same time, hope that they will always
 be nice to us. What if tomorrow they don't talk nicely to us?
 Then we will not be happy. There is dependency, and hence
 fear.
 When we understand that everything is happening here 
 in the mind, then there is no insecurity and there is no fear of
 the future. So situations could be pleasant or not so pleasant,
 and people could be pleasant or not so pleasant, I only have to
 take care of one person and that person is me. It's very simple.
 The other thing that you mentioned was about the mind
 being fickle and the only way to control it is by engaging in 
 good acts that are beneficial for all. Fickle means when the
 mind is indecisive and inconsistent. When the mind keeps
 changing, the quality of thoughts is not very nice; when we
 are peaceful, the mind works slowly and cautiously. When we
 are worried, the thoughts are very fast; when we are stable, the
 speed is slow; when we are fearful, the thoughts gain speed.
 So if my mind is fast and inconsistent, it means the quality of
 energy is not right. And now we want this mind to do an act that 
 is for the good of others. Benevolence is not in the act, it
 is first in the energy that I send out while doing the act. Here
 again, by asking you to do a benevolent act that will control the 
 mind, which is running haywire, we are putting the stress on
 'doing something outside which will help you to be peaceful'.
 ",SS,11
" But either way it works, doesn't it? Suppose I am in a
 bad mood and I start dancing; it changes my mood. Your
 mind is at least not as agitated as before, so you can take a
 better decision. What I mean to say is even the outside - in
 approach works to a certain extent?
 ",SO,11
" Outside - in works to an extent and for some time. Like
 people say when angry count to ten. When we are angry, we
 don't even realize before we react. If we had that awareness
 that now I am angry, I need to stop and drink water and count
 numbers, we would be aware enough not to react.
 ",SS,11
" So we come back to just being aware.
 ",SO,11
" Yes. These are only little-little things given to us so that we
 can pause, take a break, and work on our mind. Like you said,
 if I dance for some time at least my mind will be in a better
 position to understand. So you have just given your mind a
 little gap; I am upset with something but instead of confronting
 you right now, I take a little gap. Now what is that little gap
 for? So that I don't confront you right now. I postpone my
 external reaction. The internal reaction is there; I resolve
 issue internally and then I decide how to respond. There is a
 difference between the reaction and the response. Reaction:
 automated and not in my control; response: think, understand
 and then respond. That's why we try and bring in those time
 gaps, but sometimes, in fact quite often, the reaction is so fast 
 that the time gap is lost.
 ",SS,11
" I remember when I was in business there were so many
 letters I used to write in anger in the night, after I had
 closed down my office. I used to keep the letters for the
 next morning to post, but I never used to do it.

" The mind is moving at a very fast speed, so postpone
 your reaction till the speed slows down. See the situation in a
 different perspective and then you may respond in a different
 way. This is what we were trying to do right now. And what we
 are trying to do now is keep the mind at a slow speed always.
 ",SS,11
" Again you go back to awareness.
 ",SO,11
" Yes. If you are aware, the speed is slow. Imagine that you
 have a child playing in the room. If you are not looking at
 the child; the child will do whatever he wants. He is dropping
 things and breaking things. Now just stand in the corner and
 watch the child. Don't say or do anything, just watch the child.
 He will become aware and will control his activities.
 ",SS,11
" I try to watch this child (or mind) inside so much but
 he finds some place and escapes.
 ",SO,11
" That's the journey, and it's not going to happen in one day.
 Have you been able to do it sometimes?
 ",SS,11
" Yes.
 ",SO,11
" That's the proof that we can do it.
 ",SS,11
" Somewhere my mind doesn't like this kind of an exercise.
 ",SO,11
" A child never likes to be disciplined because he is used to
 running around wherever he wants, doing whatever he wants.
 Suddenly I say I am going to take charge of you now; now
 you are going to do only what I want you to do. But then
 gradually the mind will get used to this way of thinking because
 it's going to be at ease. Even the mind is tired now; its been
 running at a very fast speed
 ",SS,11
" Can we switch it off like we switch off the engine of a car
 ",SO,11
" We are not able to switch it off even when we are fast
 asleep at night; forget switching off in the day time. We need
 to understand why the mind works like this. There are certain
 influences on the mind. We know about positive thinking.
 yet negative and waste thinking comes naturally. What are
 the factors that influence the quality of thoughts? In any
 situation, at any time, whatever thought I create is influenced
 by three factors. One factor is past experiences. If I had an
 interaction with you before, if I had done business with you
 before, I have a past experience. Every time I think of you, my
 quality of thoughts will be based on those past experiences.
 If it had been a pleasant experience then nice thoughts come
 to me. Second factor is information - everything that I take
 in through my sense organs. What I read, what I watch,
 what I eat, everything that is going in has an effect on the
 mind; information plays a vital role on the mind. Now, the first
 thing in the morning the mind is very clean; it had a good
 rest of six hours; it is fresh and ready to create, and ready to
 absorb. In the morning we usually read the newspaper first
 or switch on the news channels. We are reading, listening and
 watching about terror, violence, natural calamities, financial
 issues, social and political upheaval, etc. The mind which is like
 a clean blotting paper absorbs this troubling information. The
 kind of information will influence the thoughts. Information
 is the food, thoughts are the resultant energy. If I have eaten
 the right food, I am going to be healthy; if I have not been
 eating the right food for the mind, my emotional immunity
 system is going to suffer.
 ",SS,11
" So that means whatever we are taking in, through media,
 through the surroundings, the quality of our thoughts is
 dependent on them.
 ",SO,11
" Negative information will give rise to negative thoughts;
 that's definite because that's the raw food that I have taken in.
 The thoughts are creating the destiny that's the mechanism
 inside, but what's creating the thoughts is the raw food, which
 is information. So, if I want to take charge of my thoughts,
 if I want to change the quality of my thoughts, I will have
 to first change the quality of the raw material that goes in.
 During the first two hours of the morning the absorption
 power of the mind is very high. If we are reading, watching
 and listening to only negative things during this time, and
 then we want positive thinking, from where and how is it
 going to happen? Then, tonight if our child hasn't come back
 home on time and his phone is out of range or switched off,
 it's so natural to think that something must have happened
 to him or her. We need to assess why we feel that something
 could have happened to him or her. Why are we creating a
 thought that is negative:?
 ",SS,11
" What kind of energy are you sending into the universe!
 ",SO,11
" Yes, we have to wait for half-an-hour and we still can't
 get in touch with the child. What is going to be the quality of
 thoughts as we wait or in any other situation like that? Then
 we will say - 'Is it not natural to think negative. How can we
 just sit back and say everything will be okay?
 ",SS,11
" Can't we think of another way that he must have met
 a friend and made other plans or he must have gone to a
 movie and the network is low there?
 ",SO,11
" How often are we able to think that someone is late because
 something nice must have happened? That's a question mark.
 Negative thinking comes easily because that's the information
 we have inside us. Even if we start with this simple practice
 of not watching the news or reading newspapers early in the
 morning, it can bring about a big change. Protect yourself, do
 not feed yourself with so much toxic food in the morning. Just
 this simple practice will bring results.
 ",SS,11
" Then you cannot blame situations because you yourself
 will be responsible.
 ",SO,11
" Situation is a trigger; the information is filled inside. When
 this trigger comes, the quality of the thoughts created will be
 influenced by the quality of the information.
 ",SS,11
" First we take in wrong information or negative
 information, then we start thinking negatively. And when
 the child comes home, we pounce on him. Why are you late?
 What happened? I was so worried.
 ",SO,11
" Why do you pounce? You pounce because in that one
 hour that you waited you were creating negative thoughts. This
 stimulant has just come and we think he is responsible for all
 that we created, so there it goes. How much toxic energy have
 we created in that one hour of wait? We sent vibrations to the
 other person and spread it to everyone around us in that one
 hour, and then we say isn't it natural. No, this is not natural
 Natural is he has not reached; I am not being able to contact
 him, and the situation is not in my control. Let us always see
 immediately what is in my control and what is not. If the
 situation is in my control, take charge; but if the situation is
 out of my control then there is only one thing in my control,
 it is the quality of my thinking.
 ",SS,11
" But tell me one thing: why is it easier to create a negative
 thought rather than a positive one?
 ",SO,11
" You just have to fill in a different quality of information. It's
 as simple as that. When I change the quality of the information
 coming in, the thoughts change, the way I respond changes,
 and my destiny changes. I have a choice. When the newspaper
 comes in the morning, I have a choice as to what time I will
 read it. So let's just postpone it; let's take this one resolve today.
 There will be a big change. Postpone the newspaper and the
 television news to the later part of the day and substitute it with 
 something very pure and powerful. A simple change to
 your morning diet for the mind will make all the difference
 So one positive thing in the morning, and one positive thing
 just before going to sleep is the remedy. What do we take in
 before going to sleep? Television serials? A horror movie?
 That's the last layer of information going with us. It will affect
 the quality of our thoughts during the night. The first layer
 of information in the morning influences our thoughts during
 the day. The last information before we go to sleep influences the quality of our thoughts at night.
 Let's devote 10 minutes to reading something pure and
 powerful after we have finished our duties for the day.We have
 to fill in the information first because if we just sit and try to
 create positive thoughts we won't be able to do it.
 We have to change the last layer of information. Once we
 finish reading, we will sit back and reflect on that, unpack what
 has happened for the day. That's very important; let's not sleep
 with unresolved issues. Go through the day. Situations had
 come up and there were times when we did not respond in
 the right way. Reflecting on the day does not mean reflecting
 on all that happened. Instead reflect on the way we responded
 and see how we could have responded in a different manner",SS,11
" How important is a belief system for happiness?
 ",SO,12
" Every thought that I create gives rise to a feeling and
 the feeling develops my attitude. The attitude comes out
 as action; repeated action becomes habit; habit develops my
 personality; and my personality determines my destiny. This
 is the process from thought to destiny. The point is that every thought becomes very important. But what determines the
 quality of my thought? Everyone is talking about positive
 thinking, so why does the negative come so naturally the
 minute there is a stimulus or a trigger? The factors that
 determine the quality of our thoughts are past experiences,
 information in which we saw the impact of media, television
 newspaper early in the morning and late at night just before
 going to sleep. These two play a very important role in the
 quality of our thoughts. The third and the most important
 factor is our belief system. Our body is like a computer, I the
 soul is the operator, and the belief system is our operating
 system. As will be the operating system, so will be the way
 the software will run on the machine. We generally say this
 software will run on this particular operating system, while
 that one will not run on another operating system. This
 machine is important, the operator is important, but the
 operating system plays a very important role. At times there
 could be a virus in the operating system, which is also a certain
 belief system that may hamper the way I think and thereby
 my destiny. Spirituality will help me to install an anti-virus.
 Many people use a computer but do not install anti-virus in
 the machine, so time and again the system tends to
 get corrupt.

 are angry with me. You do not respect me anymore. While I

 one has to be independent.
 ",SO,12
" 'In-dependent': dependent only on that one who is
 inside; let's not be 'out-dependent' because outside things
 will change and they have a reason for changing.
 ",SS,12
" Does that make you a little recluse?
 ",SO,12
" Remember always that to heal and to help others, I will
 have to be healed first. If I am healed, I will always be there
 for other people; if I am not healed and I am in pain, I can
 never be there for other people. I have to first take care of
 myself to be there for others selflessly.
 ",SS,12
" So this is selfishness in a positive manner.
 ",SO,12
" This is the foundation for being selfless. Today even
 when we are doing something for others, it is less with the
 intention of giving and more with the intention of taking.
 Even while doing for others we are satisfying some vacuum
 within ourselves, so it is actually being selfish.
 ",SS,12
" So caring for the self is necessary so that we can
 take care of the others.
 ",SO,12
" The equation flows this way only a healthy person will
 be able to heal others, will be able to understand others
 Without understanding my own thinking, my attitude, I
 want to understand why you are feeling like this. How is it
 possible? I am not ready to understand why I am hurt, but I
 want to understand why you are upset. And the wonderful
 part is when we understand how our mechanism works
 understanding others becomes easy. If I am hurt I will
 immediately be able to realize that I am hurt; I understand
 the reason and check my attitude, now it's up to me how
 much time I want to remain like that. If I am jealous, I will
 immediately come to know that I am jealous. Now if I see
 someone who is upset, I can go beyond the visible hurt to see
 what must be happening inside for them to behave like this.
 It becomes easier to be with people; you don't look only at
 the criticism, you look at the dynamics inside this person's
 mind for them to be so critical. So we just have to understand
 our mechanism - then we can understand everyone else's.
 ",SS,12
" This remind me of an incident that happened in
 the society where I live. One of the neighbours was
 angry, shouting at everybody and ready to fight. I told
 one of my friends, also a neighbour, that this person's
 behaviour was obnoxious and that I could not stand
 it. You know, this is what she said: 'what about him,
 poor chap, look at what he must be undergoing! He
 must be in some kind of pain to behave like that.' Now
 I understand what she meant. Understanding others
 is very difficult. If my wife's behaviour changes, I never
 ask her if something is wrong. I just get irritated and
 leave her alone to manage it herself. Why couldn't I ask
 her if she needed any help?
 ",SO,12
" This is withdrawal. When we can't handle other peoples
 temperaments, we withdraw. Even if it is temporary, even if it
 is for one hour, when the other person is in pain we withdraw.
 Think of your wife getting angry or behaving in a slightly
 different manner;it could be a sign that she needs help. At
 that time you move one step behind. You think when she is
 fine you will come back, but that's the time when she needs
 you more. It's because you are not able to take care of yourself
 that you move away. This is not support; we are not there for
 each other emotionally, though physically we are living in
 the same house. We are not there to heal each other because
 we have not healed ourselves.
 Suppose you are sitting with a friend and your son walks
 into the room; he has come from outside, doesn't wish you or
 your friend who is sitting there, and he just walks past both
 of you. What's the first thought that comes to the mind?
 What's wrong with him? Where are his manners? What is my
 friend going to think? He will think I haven't brought up my
 son in the right way. Will the friend go out and tell others
 how my son is? What will everyone else think about me?
 So we are nursing our own wounds. My responsibility is to
 not to question why the child is behaving like this, but see
 what is the pain inside that caused him to behave like that.
 Now you will go to his room and question his behaviour
 Your child will request you to leave his room and leave him
 alone. When the parent has been hurt or felt disrespected,
 the child will not want to be with the parent. Right now the
 child is in pain, and he doesn't want to be with anyone else
 who is in pain.
 You will love to meet somebody who is absolutely stable
 and is accepting you unconditionally, extending unconditional support.
 We don't get this from too many people, in fact from
 hardly anybody. Unconditional acceptance means I do not
 fluctuate irrespective of your temperament and I am not
 judgmental about you. Then the energy that will flow from
 anyone who accepts us unconditionally also helps us to heal
 our wound.
 ",SS,12
" We fluctuate automatically. If you raise your voice,
 I raise my voice; if you are soft, I am soft; if you smile, I
 also smile. Such complicated lives we live.
 ",SO,12
" We keep changing our behaviour according to everyone
 else. Because of this, we tend to forget our original qualities.
 My sari is white in colour but if I meet somebody in red,
 paint it red, when I meet somebody in black I paint it black,
 and when I meet somebody in green I paint it green. At
 the end of the day there is no white left. So where is my
 personality? I coloured my personality according to everyone
 else's personality. And it's actually not their personality either;
 it's my perspective about their personality. We don't know
 people as they actually are.
 ",SS,12
" Actually we are not capable of knowing.
 ",SO,12
" Because we are seeing them through our perspective.
 There is only one person who knows me well and that's my
 own self. No one can claim to say that they know me very
 well - no, they know me through their perspective and that
 perspective keeps changing
 ",SS,12
" So a child knows his father from his perspective.
 ",SO,12
" Absolutely. The same father will get along with his three
 children in different ways because the children see the same
 father in a different perspective. One might be very scared but
 that's because he or she is weak; one could be very confident
 and could run and get onto his lap; one will just stand in
 the corner neither scared nor very confident. The father is
 the same, though his nature and personality is the same.
 So if one is comfortable, why are the others scared? One is
 a meek personality, so he sees the same father through his
 perspective.
 ",SS,12
" Let's consider a normal couple. If a
 husband is tough, the wife says can't you be nice some
 time, 'can't you speak softly, 'can't you be loving', and so
 on. Conversely, if a person is very loving and soft, his
 wife will say'can't you be tough sometimes, look at what
 that fellow said to me'. Even from your perspective, you
 are not happy with one kind of role your partner plays;
 you want them to play different roles all the time.
 ",SO,12
" Because we have created an image of the right husband.
 We get into a relationship with the image of an ideal partner
 and an ideal friend, and then we spend our life time trying
 to change our partner into that image. Let's say my image is
 that of a partner who is an extrovert, dynamic and loud. But
 I have a partner who is very soft and quiet, and an introvert.
 According to me, this is not how my partner should be
 So it's not about how he is as an individual; it's about what
 image I created in my mind. I will keep on saying this is not
 how you should be, you should be loud, you should be more
 open, you should be like this, you should be like that. Then
 if he becomes an extrovert, I will say, not that much, a little
 less. So I want the person to be exactly the way I want him
 to be. It's like going to a tailor who prepares your costume
 according to the measurement that he prefers. He tells you
 that now you have to change your body and fit into it. He
 expects you to fit into the costume that he has made rather
 than creating the costume according to your measurement.
 And that's why we keep fluctuating. We keep changing
 according to what everybody wants.

 not stable?

" To come out of this struggle, not be suffocated, and
 be stable, can we have some kind of a meditation?

 influencing our mind.
 ",SO,13
" We cannot avoid our past experiences. They are already
 recorded in the memory, but we can try not to play the
 same record again and again. Because every time we play it,
 we are converting the past into the present. We are creating
 the same emotions all over again, and every time we create
 the same emotion, we deepen the sanskar. We deepen the
 wound, by scratching it. It's a past wound, we need to heal
 it, but suppose we open the Band-Aid from time to time
 and scratch it, how will the wound get healed. Sometimes
 we also get others to join us. So the wound never heals. The
 past has passed. Full stop. No comma, no question mark, no
 exclamation mark. Why, what, how Full stop. So that we
 are able to move ahead, fresh and clean, and now what we
 create, will get recorded. People say we remember the past
 because we have to learn from the past, but what do we have
 to learn from the past? We just have to check the way we
 responded and learn if there was a more comfortable way of
 responding. There is nothing to learn from the situation, we
 only have to learn from our response. Holding on to things,
 not letting them go, accumulating, it is only going to cause
 pain. It's like you are holding on to something; the weight
 of the object remains the same but the longer we hold it, the
 more the hand is going to hurt.

" That's what is meant by opening everyone's Band-Aid
 together and scrubbing on the wounds. We went through so
 much of pain but when we think about it again, we experience
 the same pain all over again. So we need to ask our self: how
 many times am I going to go through the same emotions
 again and again? More importantly anything done repeatedly
 becomes my personality, and then I carry that personality
 with me everywhere. We may not discuss the past situation
 with everyone, but because it's in our mind it will be part of
 our vibrations.

" But don't you also attract such people and such
 situations?
 ",SO,13
" We are not attracting situations, but we are responding
 to situations in a similar manner as before. If there is a
 challenge, since we are already emotionally low, we don't
 have the power to face the situation in a proactive way. I
 am already hurt about something that happened years
 back, and here comes another fresh stimulus. I don't have
 the strength. The pain that I will create will be much more
 than what I would have created had I healed my past. Also
 pain created because of one particular situation or person,
 does not remain only in that relationship with that person
 The pain has now become a part of my personality, and I
 will tend to get hurt more easily in other relationships too.

 the stimulus and say I am hurt, but now its my personality

 person. So I am vulnerable every time. It's not about changing
 your job, its not about changing your partner, your friends,
 your spouse; it's about making yourself stronger.

 immunity system, is strong wherever you are, with whoever

 it's not him or her, it's me I have to work on. Things change.

 response.

" They will say 'if you speak like this, then naturally I
 will respond like this'. How do you still change?
 ",SO,13
" So that is the realisation. 'You speak like this' but now
 I will choose how I am going to respond. The equation has
 changed. I got a phone call from a twenty-four-year- old
 married woman, standing on the terrace of her house wanting
 to jump down. As a last resort she just called up and said,
 'I don't want to live and I was about to jump down, but I
 thought I will just call up and find out if you have a solution.
 My husband is having an affair with somebody in the office
 and he wants to divorce me. I see no reason to live. She was
 totally shattered. 'What about my parents, society and others?""
 At that moment I was speechless. I said, 'Okay, first come
 down. So what is it that you want? She said, 'I want everything
 to be back to normal like it was. I want my family life, my
 married life to be what it was.' I said, create a thought that
 everything is fine'. She said, 'but everything is not fine. I said,
 'I know, but what do you want?"" 'I want everything to be
 fine. I said, 'now create a thought that everything is fine and
 my husband is absolutely fine; nothing wrong has happened'.
 For 10 days or so, we were talking daily for almost an hour
 on the phone. She used to say, 'everything is not fine how 
 can I create this thought that everything is fine? What should
 I do? Should I go and talk to that girl? Should I go and talk 
 to that girl's parents? Should I go and talk to my husband's
 parents, what should I do? I had to repeatedly get her back
 to creating the same thought, that everything was fine.
 Finally she started working on changing her thought; she
 said 'everything is fine, my husband is absolutely fine, nothing
 wrong has happened'. She stopped crying also, eventually she
 became more stable. Now when her husband came back from
 work, she wouldn't be crying or weeping; this provoked him
 even more. He would be abusive and find more faults with
 her because he was trying to justify his own action. She had
 to remain stable and just keep telling herself that 'everything
 is okay, I am in charge of the situation, and I am in charge
 of myself'. After one month her husband handed over the
 divorce paper to her; he said that his company was sending
 him to the USA and that the other girl working in the offce
 was also going. They were going to get married there. She
 called me up and told me what happened. Then she surprised
 me by saying, 'you know I am fine, I think I will be able to
 take care of myself. I will take up a job and I will be able to
 live with my parents.' In one month she had changed her
 thoughts. The situation was the same as it was one month
 before, but she had changed her thoughts. She just worked
 hard on herself. The husband left.
 Two months later he called up from the USA and said
 he wanted to come back. She called me up and asked 'what
 should I do? I asked, what do you want? She said, I want
 everything to be back to normal.
 ",SS,13
" That's what she always wanted.
 ",SO,13
" Yes. And today it's more than four years since that episode.
 They have a lovely daughter too. All the effort was made by
 her. It's only that she had to take up the
 challenge; it's a little extra effort initially.
 ",SS,13
" Did you feel a sense of failure when the husband
 was leaving the next day and they did not patch up?
 ",SO,13
" It was not a failure. We were not looking at the situation;
 we were only concerned about her being able to take charge of
 her own state of mind. Situations are not in our control. We
 expect that spirituality or religion will change our problems.
 No, they won't. Problems are going to come, challenges are going
 to come, obstacles are going to come; spirituality gives me the
 power to take charge of myself and then face the situation.
 ",SS,13
" But when she was creating the thoughts that
 everything is fine, she was trying to change the situation.
 ",SO,13
" She was changing her thoughts
 ",SS,13
" By changing the situation in her imagination.
 ",SO,13
" It's not imagining. Everything is fine here (in my mind);
 it's here first. I have to be okay; everything is fine.

 said 'just think that everything is fine; nothing is wrong'

" If a partner or a child is drifting away in a relationship
 what's the energy that we send out to them? Anger or hurt
 Someone is already drifting away and we are sending out
 negative energy. It will only take them further away. If you
 want the person to come back, you have to send powerful
 positive energy. For that we need to stop being critical and
 judgmental about that person. We need to respect them as
 we always did, and so we need to create the thought that
 nothing wrong has happened. From the other person's
 perspective, they have logic for what they are doing; we may
 find it wrong but they have a reason. I have spoken to
 many families where there is a conflict between partners or
 between parent and children. If you talk to both parties, you
 will never be able to decide who is right and who is wrong
 because none of them is wrong. You listen to one and you will
 say, 'perfect, this person is absolutely right'. Then you listen
 to the other person and what they say seems to be making
 sense as well. It's just that each one is right from their own
 perspective. Now all that we have to do is show them each
 other's perspective.

 and knowledge.
 ",SO,13
" I will tell you about this couple. The wife had been living
 separately for the last three months because the husband used
 to beat her. The physical violence had been happening for
 10 years; finally she took her daughter and left. She met
 me to see if any solution was possible. She was constantly
 weeping while she was talking about it. I asked her how
 her husband's childhood had been. She said it was not
 pleasant; he was a single child to working parents, who did
 not have much time for him, and he had been very lonely.
 What I understood was that the husband felt he had not
 got love from others around him; in his wife he found one
 person whom he could call his own, and the way he showed
 power and control over his wife was violence. It was actually
 because he was insecure and possessive, and he was in a lot
 of pain inside. Now, instead of hatred she was filled with
 sympathy. She said, my husband was in pain all this while,
 and I thought I was the one who was in pain. This reality
 changed her, and now they are healing each other. It's not
 that the situation is solved in one day because the husband
 says he doesn't know what happens to him. Such things
 happen because of some mind block inside. It's just that
 we need to be able to detach ourselves from our position,
 go to their position, and see what could be the reason for
 their behaviour. But what happens is when the husband does
 something wrong to the wife, the wife only feels her own
 hurt. She fails to understand what the husband is going
 through, and vice versa.
 ",SS,13
" What if both of them had a bad childhood?
 ",SO,13
" The wife was constantly weeping. She kept telling the
 husband 'promise me that you will never hit me again, only
 then will I go home. The husband said 'I promise I will try'
 She said 'no, give me a guarantee that you will never do it
 again. So I told the lady, you guarantee that you are never
 going to cry again.' She promptly said l will try. It's so easy
 to tell other people to change because we don't have control
 over our own sanskar.
 ",SS,13
" But can we change the sanskars?
 ",SO,13
" Yes, definitely, by understanding and seeing what the
 reason is.
 ",SS,13
" How can I find the reason within me? It takes 'you'
 to find it or can 'I' find it? Suppose I get angry very easily,
 how do I know what kind of sanskars I have? Will I have
 to go through my past?
 ",SO,13
" Definitely you need to see your past. Suppose someone has
 had a troubled childhood- the parents were critical, physically
 abusive, etc. The child always has to keep proving himself,
 and still keep going through pain because of the criticism
 received. Now as this child grows up, he builds a defense
 mechanism. He does not want to go through the hurt and
 pain, and so he becomes loud and aggressive. Before anyone
 can say anything to him, he will shout at people. People will
 fear him. This is a protection wall that the person builds so
 that no one can ever say anything to him, but inside he is
 an innocent, fearful and hurt child.
 ",SS,13
" He had gone through some situations that he could
 not fight.
 ",SO,13
" Not only that, the child experienced hurt at that time.
 Now the child doesn't want to get hurt again, and this will
 be so even when he is 30, 40 or 50 years old. Now when this
 person starts working on himself and says I will not get hurt
 even if someone says something, he becomes strong insideNow he can drop this artificial defense mechanism and be
 his natural, polite, sweet self to everyone.
 ",SS,13
" So all these things can be overcome by being aware
 of your thoughts. By being aware, you also detach, don't
 you?
 ",SO,13
" Absolutely, because we get detached our self from our own
 perspective. Like in the case of this couple, the wife could see
 only her perspective, 'how can my husband hit me, he does
 not love me, he does not respect me. What she is feeling is
 right, but she can see only her perspective. When she detached
 from her perspective, she was able to see her husband's pain
 and his perspective; she became stable. Her hatred turned
 into sympathy.
 We all talk about understanding people. We say we cannot
 understand the other person, which means we just cannot see
 their perspective because we are so attached to ours.
 Earlier we could see the situation only from our side, and
 from our side it was totally different. For me to be able to
 see from your side I have to get up from this chair and then
 come and sit on that chair. For that I have to detach myself
 from this chair; I am so stuck to my position, to my ideas
 of right that I can't even get up from here. When I get up
 to be on your side, that's empathy and understanding, and
 that's a relationship.

" You were mentioning the other day that when a
 person is empty within, he becomes angry. What do
 you mean by emptiness within?

 in life, professionally, personally, materialistically. But inside
 there is something amiss. They are not even very sure what

 kind of an emotional fulfilment they are looking for?

 we have got everything but we are still experiencing stress
 anger and anxiety. So I am empty in the sense that what I
 wanted I haven't got, even though I got the whole list that
 I thought would give me contentment. Then I say I am
 empty. While achieving this success, we compromised a lot.
 That compromise made us empty. Peace is our nature, but we
 created anger. Honesty is our nature but we compromised on
 that a number of times in order to achieve success. Humility
 is our nature but created ego to feel powerful. Every time we
 were doing these things, we were going against our natural
 personality.

" So you feel bad about it, perhaps guilty too.
 ",SO,13
" Not only feel bad now, we think of how the journey
 has been. Let's say this glass is full. Now I am on a journey
 towards success but I have to take care that the glass should
 not spill. If I keep spilling the glass during the journey, some
 10 years later I would have achieved success but the glass will
 be empty by the time I reach there. Then I will say that l am
 empty because I created so much anger and resentment. I did everything posible to achieve that success. It doesn't mean
 that success is wrong; just that I should have taken care of
 this glass while moving towards success.
 ",SS,13

 empty, weren't we?

" No, look at a child - so contented. That's whats so
 attractive about the child. We teach the child that in order

 he has to get tensed and compete with his friends. Look at
 the child when the child is sleeping - such serenity.",SS,13
